<b>Founder Technology Group and Lenovo to Distribute Java Runtime Environment</b>

<p><b> SANTA CLARA, CALIF. June 21, 2006 Sun Microsystems, Inc. (Nasdaq: SUNW), the creator and leading advocate of Java technology, today announced it will be incorporating Java DB, the Sun supported distribution of the open source Apache Derby Project, as well as the Group Layout component from the NetBeans GUI Builder code-named Project Matisse (<a href="https://swing-layout.dev.java.net/">https://swing-layout.dev.java.net/</a>) into the latest version of the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/">Java Platform Standard Edition 6 (Java SE 6) Java Development Kit (JDK)</a>. In addition, Sun announced new agreements with Founder Technology Group and Lenovo to ship the JavaRuntime Environment (JRE) on their hardware.</b></p>

<p>The second Beta release of Java SE 6 technology is now available at: <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6">http://java.sun.com/javase/6</a>. Developers are encouraged to begin their transition to Java SE 6 platform and leverage the enhancements and expanded functionality of the latest release. Scheduled for final release in the Fall of 2006, the Java SE 6 platform is the result of an industry-wide development effort that involves open review, weekly builds and extensive collaboration between Sun engineers and over 330 external developers. In addition, Sun announced the expansion of service programs for Java SE 6 developers ranging from programming-specific advice to enterprise support with its Sun Developer Expert Assistance (DEA) Program and Sun Developer Service Plans (DSP).</p>

<p><b>Java DB in Java SE 6</b></p>

<p>Beginning today, Java DB will be available through the early access weekly builds of Java SE 6. Although it has a footprint of only two megabytes (MB), Java DB is a sophisticated, fully transactional, relational Java technology-based database with support for open standards, triggers,and stored procedures. Java DB can be used either in client-server mode or embedded directly into a Java application where it can run in the same Java Virtual Machine (JVM), eliminating the need to acquire, download, install, or administer the database separately from the application. Sun offers support services for customers who choose to use Java DB in production.</p>

<p><b>Rapid Visual Development of Swing Applications</b></p>

<p>Java SE 6 will also include the new layout manager component that enables developers to create standards-based GUI layouts easily and efficiently. GroupLayout is a key component of the NetBeans GUI Builder (code named Project Matisse) that makes the design of a Java technology GUI as simple as using a WYSIWYG drawing program. With a form builder that provides visual guidelines for optimal spacing between components and their alignments, there is no need to know the underlying Swing constructs or guidelines for different looks and feels.

<p><b>Expanding Java Technology Availability on the Desktop</b></p>

<p>Founder Technology Group and Lenovo have both signed licensing agreements to ship the latest JRE on a broad range of business and consumer desktop and notebook PCs starting as early as the third quarter of this year. As a result, their customers will have immediate access to the latest Java technology-based content and applications. With this announcement, Founder Technology Group and Lenovo join the list of leading PC manufacturers around the world that distribute the Java platform on their hardware, which also includes: Acer, Apple Computer Inc., Dell Computer Corporation, Gateway, HP, Samsung, Toshiba and Tsinghua Tongfang.</p>

<p>Sun recently launched a new program for PC Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) to distribute Java SE technology. Using a simple online application and single 'click-through' approval of the distribution agreement PC OEMs can sign up for the program at: <a href="http://java.com/">http://java.com</a>. Once approved into the program, the companies can distribute Java SE technology on the systems they deliver and receive online support for the integration of the Java platform into their installation, configuration and distribution processes.</p>

<p><b>Compatibility Matters</b></p>

<p>A top priority for the Java SE 6 software is to protect developers' current and future investments by helping to ensure compatibility. Earlier this year, Sun sponsored the "Regressions Challenge" contest and invited developers to test their applications on the Java SE 6 platform. The contest resulted in more than 130 submissions and 72 bugs were filed ï¿½ more than half of which already have fixes (<a href="http://download.java.net/jdk/Mustang-Regressions.html">http://download.java.net/jdk/Mustang-Regressions.html</a>). In addition, almost 160 companies are working with Sun to help enable compatibility by actively testing their Java technology-based applications on the Java SE 6 platform.</p>

<p>Developers are encouraged to try out the latest features in Java SE 6 software Beta using the NetBeans IDE 5.0 software tools via download at http://www.netbeans.org. Sun's Developer Services programs (<a href="http://developers.sun.com/services">http://developers.sun.com/services</a>) offer Java developers a complete line of developer how-to help, product support and updates, and training that reduces time and risk for the entire application lifecycle--from development through deployment. Java developers are also encouraged to join the Sun Developer Network Program, at no cost, by registering online at: <a href="http://developers.sun.com/register">http://developers.sun.com/register</a>.</p>
