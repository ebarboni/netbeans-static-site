Prague, Czech Republic, August 31, 1998 - NetBeans, Inc. announces its distribution partnership with NETSALES.  From September 1, 1998, NetBeans and NETSALES will collaborate on the worldwide distribution of NetBeans products.

"We're excited about this new relationship with NETSALES, our first major step in the NetBeans global distribution strategy.  Our goal is to provide our products in three clicks and three minutes to anyone connected to the Internet.  We're looking forward to 
working closely with NETSALES to set a new standard for software publishing," added Roman Stanek, Founder and CEO of NetBeans, Inc..</p>

<p>NetBeans' product line consists of NetBeans Developer 2.0, a single-platform, single-user edition of the IDE, and NetBeans Enterprise, scheduled for a year-end release, a team-centric programming environment for multiple users 
working on multiple platforms.</p>
