Prague, Czech Republic, March 2, 1999 - NetBeans today launched DeveloperX2
2.1, one of the first full-featured Integrated Development Environments
(IDEs) to support and run on Sun Microsystems, Inc.'s Java 2(tm) platform.
DeveloperX2 2.1 enables software developers to build sophisticated Java
Foundation Classes (JFC) GUIs, compile, and debug applications on the
platform of their choice.  NetBeans also simultaneously launched a concurrent
version, Developer 2.1, which supports Swing 1.1 and Java Development Kit(tm)
(JDK) 1.1.</p>

<p>"NetBeans has made a commitment to Java technology developers to keep them
ahead of the technology curve," said Roman Stanek, Founder/CEO of NetBeans,
Inc..  "This release gives developers what they need to leverage the new
Java platform."</p>

<p>"We are excited to see today's announcement from NetBeans," said
Jon Kannegaard, Vice President and General Manager of the Java platform
at Sun Microsystems.  "NetBeans' innovative JavaBeans architecture allows
easy extensibility, and the ability to update the IDE to work with new
technologies has enabled them to quickly bring to market a solid product
that supports Sun's newest Java technology."</p>

<p>"By using NetBeans DeveloperX2 with the Java 2 platform, developers can use
all the new features of this latest JDK such as Swing component framework,
collections, security, beans enhancements and many others," said Ian Formanek,
Chief Technology Officer at NetBeans, Inc..  "The upcoming release of NetBeans
Developer (codename Gandalf) will provide even better support for these new
features."</p>

<p>Software developers appreciate the NetBeans promise of true platform
independence.  "Its multiplatform support is the best I've seen in any
program!" commented Jose Alburquerque, a NASA Programmer.  Per-Ola Lindell,
Managing Director of PO Lindell Software Development, added, "I am a software
development consultant and have been using NetBeans on both NT and Solaris -
and I must say that I am impressed.  This is the only tool I have seen that
runs on both platforms (Unix and NT) and supports JDK 1.1 & 1.2.  The tool has
a very user-friendly and nice design, and it is my tool of choice.  I will
gladly recommend NetBeans to my customers."</p>

<p>NetBeans Developer is a programming tool for software developers who want to
design and build powerful, cross-platform applications - on any platform.
NetBeans was designed for the Java platform and features sophisticated support
for visual development of JFC applications.  It is a powerful development tool
that is easy to learn and intuitive to operate.</p>

<p>NetBeans Developer combines support for all stages of application development
including visual design, coding, compiling, and debugging in a comprehensive
visual programming package.  It is available in two versions which run on all
platforms that support JDK 1.1 and 1.2, respectively, including Windows
95/98/NT, Linux, Solaris(tm), HP-UX, OS/2, AIX, SGI Irix, and others.  The IDE
is based on JFC and JavaBeans Components, and all parts of the IDE are
actually themselves JavaBeans.  The result is an IDE where the user can fully
customize the interface, modify component behavior and easily add new
components.</p>

<p>The next version of Developer (codename Gandalf) will fully support the Java 2
platform including JDBC support, a new editor, more advanced debugging, drag
'n drop, Beans enhancements, collections, image processing, printing, and
more.  In addition, a set of Open APIs will be the introduced to allow third
parties to customize NetBeans and create tightly integrated add-ons.</p>

<p>NetBeans Enterprise will allow teams of developers to build full-scale
distributed Java technology-based applications.  In addition to the features
of Developer, Enterprise will feature several additional modules: Version
control systems support (integration with multiple vendors); database
connectivity - JDBC; Enterprise JavaBeans support - EJB; distributed computing
support - RMI and CORBA; and directory services - JNDI.</p>

<p>The next edition of Developer as well as Enterprise will be released as Beta
versions early in Q2, 1999, and are scheduled to ship later in the quarter.</p>
