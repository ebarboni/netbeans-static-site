Oakland, CA and Prague, Czech Republic, September 21, 1998-NetBeans, Inc. and Cloudscape(TM) Inc. announced today that NetBeans, Inc. will bundle Cloudscape's embeddable Java-based object relational database with upcoming releases of the NetBeans IDE. Founded on  the principle of Java innovation, NetBeans is the first company to offer an all-Java IDE based on Swing/JFC. Cloudscape offers the 
industry's first embeddable Java database, designed to be invisibly embedded within applications as a local data manager.

<p>The Cloudscape database will be bundled with NetBeans Developer 2.0, allowing users of NetBeans Developer 2.0 to create Java applications that integrate a fully functional, yet lightweight object-relational database manager. The 
integrated product is expected to be available in November 1998. NetBeans Developer 2.0, written entirely in the Java(TM) language and based on Sun's Java Foundation Classes framework, is a full-featured, object oriented, visual 
programming environment that allows flexible development on any platform that supports JDK 1.1.x, including Win95/98/NT, Apple Mac, Linux, OS/2, Solaris, HP-UX, Irix and others. It combines the cross-platform compatibility of Java with the ease-of-use of a visual RAD programming environment, in a package that offers serious software developers a full set of advanced tools in an intuitive format. Since the release of NetBeans Developer 2.0 - Beta 1 in late June, over 18,000 new registered users have downloaded the IDE. Cloudscape ships a 100% Pure Java object-relational DBMS that provides SQL access to complex data and logic and features a small footprint. It can be extended with Java class libraries, and can manage data of any type and logic of any complexity.</p>

<p>"The combination of NetBeans and Cloudscape is a marriage of two 'best of breed' 
technologies," said Roman Stanek, founder and CEO of NetBeans, Inc. "Our 
bundling redefines the concept of 'Integrated Development Environment,' and 
thanks to our Java foundations, the joining will be seamless. With one visionary 
technology, Java, we've brought together two innovative tools."</p>

<p>"We're pleased to work with NetBeans to provide portable Java-based database 
management to users of the NetBeans development environment " said Malcolm 
Colton, vice president of marketing, Cloudscape Inc. "Together, the two products 
free developers from the constraints of traditional application development, 
allowing them to deploy database enabled applications that support even 
disconnected clients."</p>
