<b>SANTA CLARA, Calif. March 5, 2007 Sun Microsystems, Inc. (Nasdaq: SUNW) and the NetBeans Community, today announced an early access release of the NetBeans Ruby Pack which provides support for the Ruby programming language. The NetBeans plug-in offers developers added support for dynamic and scripting languages and includes editing features for both Ruby and JRuby - a 100% pure-Java implementation of the Ruby programming language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine.</b>

<p>The NetBeans Ruby Pack goes beyond basic editing, syntax highlighting, navigation outline, project support and unit test execution to provide developers with a rich set of features to enhance productivity. These features include: code completion for modules, classes, methods and escape codes within literal strings and regular expressions. The NetBeans Ruby Pack also offers extended features such as integrated documentation pop-ups for Ruby API calls, semantic analysis with highlighting of parameters and unused local variables, as well as occurrence highlighting.</p>

<p>"Developing these plug-ins for NetBeans is yet another demonstration of our commitment to support dynamic languages," said Jeet Kaul, vice president for Developer Products and Programs, Sun Microsystems. "NetBeans -- with its broad adoption -- now extends its reach into a new community of users while exposing the existing Java development community to the power of the Ruby language. Building this synergy is what makes open-source a powerful strategy for aligning and moving the technology industry forward."</p>

<p>Ruby support is available for NetBeans 6 Milestone 7 as a download from the Autoupdate Center. Additional support for Ruby on Rails is expected to be available mid-year 2007.</p>

<p>Make plans to join us on May 7th for the fourth annual NetBeans Day that will be held the day before the 2007 JavaOne conference event, speakers will include: Charles Nutter, Thomas Enebo and Tor Norbye. </p>
