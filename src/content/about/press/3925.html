<center><b>Sun Java Web Start Technology and NetBeans IDE 5.0 Recognized as Industry Leaders in Java Technology Development</b></center>

<p><b> SANTA CLARA, CALIF. September 11, 2006 Sun Microsystems, Inc.(Nasdaq: SUNW), the creator and leading advocate of Java technology, today announced two leading Java technology products - <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/">Sun Java Web Start technology</a> and <a href="http://www.netbeans.org">NetBeans Integrated Development Environment (IDE) 5.0</a> - as recipients of the Java Developer's Journal Editor's Choice Awards. Additionally, Java Developer's Journal recognized SwingLabs, a Sun-sponsored umbrella project for various open source initiatives that is part of the java.net community.</b></p>

<p>The Java Developer's Journal Editor's Choice Awards are granted annually by the editors who each select their top choices for software products from the last 12 months that they believe have made a major impact on the Java technology community. The latest release of the Sun Java Web Start technology was recognized for allowing first class, easy and polished large-scale distribution of Java clients on the desktop. NetBeans IDE 5.0 was recognized for having everything software developers need to develop cross-platform desktop, Web, and mobile applications with ease of use. SwingLabs was recognized as an innovative project for open source initiatives that allows for development to occur outside of the Java Community Project and then get incorporated back into the Java Platform Standard Edition (Java SE).</p>

<p>"We are honored to have two of our Java products and SwingLabs chosen by the editors of Java Developer's Journal," said Tim Cramer, executive director NetBeans, Sun Microsystems, Inc. "This recognition proves our continuous momentum in offering best-in-class solutions and choice products for our customers and to the benefit of the Java community."</p>

<p>"Sun Java Web Start technology, NetBeans IDE 5.0 and the Sun-sponsored SwingLabs project have undoubtedly impacted the development done by our readers in their day jobs as software coders, along with the Java community as a whole," said Jeremy Geelan, senior vice president, editorial and events at SYS-CON Media, publisher of Java Developer's Journal. "We are pleased that our editors have chosen to honor Sun for three of the best products and initiatives over the last 12 months, citing the excellent usability, ease of deployment and great enterprise support of these products." </p>

<p>By using Java Web Start technology, <a href="http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/">http://java.sun.com/products/javawebstart/</a>, standalone Java software applications can be deployed with a single click over the network.

NetBeans IDE 5.0 is an open source Java IDE that includes comprehensive support for developing IDE plug-in modules and rich client applications based on the NetBeans platform available at: <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/">http://www.netbeans.org</a>. SwingLabs, <a href="http://swinglabs.org/">http://swinglabs.org</a>, is an open source laboratory for exploring new ways to make Swing applications easier to write, with improved performance and greater visual appeal.
