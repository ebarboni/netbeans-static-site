<p><b> SANTA CLARA, CALIF. June 6, 2006 Sun Microsystems, Inc. (Nasdaq: SUNW), the creator and leading advocate of Java technology, today announced JBoss has endorsed the NetBeans Integrated Development Environment (IDE) and has joined the NetBeans Partner program.</b></p>
<p>
"We are endorsing the NetBeans IDE because of JBoss and Sun's mutual dedication to simplifying development of standards-based Java EE applications. We will work closely with the NetBeans team to develop a plug-in for the NetBeans IDE that provides developers with the tools for doing development with JBoss Application Server. NetBeans has great momentum in the market because it consistently delivers innovative solutions to enhance developer productivity," said Marc Fleury, founder and President of JBoss, Inc.
</p>
<p>
As the primary sponsor of the NetBeans open source project, Sun will work with JBoss to create an installer that includes the award-winning NetBeans IDE and the JBoss Application Server in one bundle. This will allow developers to do a single installation and then immediately begin developing Java EE applications.
</p>
<p>
"We are very pleased to welcome JBoss to the rapidly expanding NetBeans Partner program. There is a large cross-section of our developer community that uses JBoss technology and they will benefit from this relationship," said Jeff Jackson, senior vice president of Java and Enterprise Development at Sun.
