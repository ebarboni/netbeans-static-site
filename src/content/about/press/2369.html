<h3>Sun Microsystems Incorporates Open Java DB Into Java Enterprise System</h3>
<p><b>Offers Additional Support for the Sun Supported Distribution of the Apache Derby Database with NetBeans IDE 5.0 Plug-In</b></p>

Menlo Park, Calif. - December 13, 2005 - Sun Microsystems Inc. (NASDAQ: SUNW), the creator and leading advocate of Java technology, today further reinforced its position that the <a href="http://www.sun.com/solaris/">Solaris 10 Operating System (OS)</a> is the best platform for database development and deployment by announcing the incorporation of the open source Java DB, the Sun supported distribution of the Apache Derby Project, into the <a href="http://www.sun.com/jes/">Sun Java Enterprise System</a>. Sun also announced additional support for the database with a new plug-in to be included in the upcoming NetBeans IDE 5.0, a complete open source development environment for building and deploying Java applications.
</b><br />

</p>
 
<p>
The latest release of the Sun Java Enterprise System (release 4) now uses the open Java DB as its application-embedded and Java developer database. The open Java DB is incorporated in the Sun Java System Portal Server 7.0 for use in data storage; it is used as well as the development database within all versions of the Sun Java System Application Server, including the open source Project GlassFish.
</p>
 
<p>
"The open Java DB is the best database for Java application development, and a great fit for Java developers. And since Sun has made its software portfolio available at no cost, we make it even easier for developers and customers to take advantage of this enhanced environment," said John Loiacono, executive vice president of Software at Sun.  
</p>
 
<p>
As well, a plug-in for the open Java DB will be available with the upcoming release of the NetBeans IDE 5.0, allowing developers to easily build and deploy applications that leverage the open Java DB. This is in addition to the support Sun provides developers who use the Java agents for DTrace for optimizing their applications on the Solaris OS. The open Java DB plug-in is available now from the Autoupdate Center for the Beta Release and is accessed through the Tools menu of the product. 
</p>
 
<p>
NetBeans provides the developer with the most comprehensive development environment available: mobile, desktop, web and enterprise applications can all be created with one single tool. And nearly every application requires a database. Therefore, this plug-in support will allow developers to easily build and deploy any kind of application using the open Java DB.  DTrace is a comprehensive, advanced tracing tool for troubleshooting systemic problems in real time. With DTrace, administrators, integrators, and developers can tune applications for performance and troubleshoot production systems--all with little or no performance impact. 
</p>

 
<p>
"Sun's work with the open Java DB, its support for PostgreSQL and Oracle's recent move to make the Solaris OS its open source 64-bit development and deployment platform have made it easier for Sun customers to choose the best database for their specific goals and further establishes the Solaris OS as the most open, highest performing and most optimized database platform," said Loiacono. 
</p>
 
<p>
The Apache Derby Project is actively supported by Sun and IBM developers and the project has emerged as a strong Java database development platform for application portability and for embedded use within an application or even a browser. Sun currently has over 30 contributors and commiters to the Apache Derby community project.  More information on the Apache Derby Project can be found at: <a href="http://db.apache.org/derby/">http://db.apache.org/derby/</a>.
</p>
 
<p>
Apache Derby is now supported by the recently-released Apache Roller 2.0, a Java-based open source blog server currently under incubation at the Apache Software Foundation. A web-based application, Roller supports multiple simultaneous weblog users and visitors and is the blog server used to drive <a href="http://blogs.sun.com">http://blogs.sun.com</a>.
