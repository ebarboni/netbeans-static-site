<p><b>Swing User Interface Builder Available Now In Development Preview</b></p>
<p><b>
SANTA CLARA, Calif. -  March 20, 2006 - Sun Microsystems Inc. (Nasdaq: SUNW), the creator and leading advocate of Java(TM) Technology, together with the NetBeans(TM) community and Genuitec LLC, today  announced a preview of the Matisse4MyEclipse GUI Builder plug-in. The Genuitec implementation of the NetBeans GUI Builder -- previously codenamed Project Matisse - enables the easy creation of Java Swing rich-client applications within the MyEclipse environment. Based on the GUI Builder feature recently released in NetBeans 5.0, Matisse4MyEclipse provides users with the power and usability that has been creating excitement in the Java development community - and driving momentum for the NetBeans IDE - for the past year.  
</b></p>
<p> 
Genuitec is widely known as a provider of low cost, innovative RAD tools for Java and Java EE development. Its MyEclipse Enterprise Workbench IDE extends the Eclipse platform to support UML, web/AJAX, EJB/Spring/Hibernate, database, and rich client platform development for the full application life-cycle. 
</p>
<p> 
"We've had numerous requests to provide a Swing visual UI designer to facilitate Java rich-client development within MyEclipse," according to Maher Masri, president of Genuitec. "Since our user community kept referring to "Matisse-like" capabilities, we decided they would be better served if we integrated Matisse itself, rather than try to duplicate the effort. Due to the positive experience we've had to date with NetBeans technologies, we're looking forward to further collaboration with both the Eclipse and NetBeans communities in the future."
</p> 
 <p>
In addition to incorporating features from Project Matisse, the NetBeans 5.0 IDE provides comprehensive support for building Java Platform, Standard Edition (Java SE), Java Platform, Enterprise Edition (Java EE) and Java Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME) applications. This latest version also supports a variety of technology packs that differentiate it from other developer tools including the NetBeans Enterprise Pack for SOA development and UML modelling support, and the NetBeans C/C++ Pack for developing native applications for Solaris(TM), Linux and Windows Operating Systems. 
 </p>
<p>
"With more than 9 million downloads of NetBeans, NetBeans is demonstrating momentum in the market," according to Tim Cramer, director of Java Tools, Sun Microsystems. "The adoption of Matisse for MyEclipse by Genuitec is further demonstration that NetBeans continues to offer innovative, high-quality IDE features. And, the healthy competition in the Java tools ecosystem is driving productive features into the hands of developers faster than ever."
