<p><b>C/C++ source code development supported through new NetBeans plug-in</b></p>
<p><b>
SANTA CLARA, Calif. - March 20, 2006 - Sun Microsystems Inc. (Nasdaq: SUNW), the creator and leading advocate of Java(TM) technology, today announced the release of a preview version of the NetBeans(TM) C/C++ Development Pack. This plug-in is supported in NetBeans 5.0 and preview versions of NetBeans Enterprise Pack 5.5 across common platforms, including Solaris(TM) 10, Linux, and Microsoft Windows Operating Systems. 
</b></p>
<p>"The NetBeans community is clamoring for this support. Developers were unhappy with the current offerings in the marketplace for an open multi-language, multi-platform, native development environment and this milestone is the first response from the NetBeans community," said Don Kretsch, director Sun Studio Tools, at Sun. "The rapid momentum in this area signals not only the flexibility and simplicity of the NetBeans plug-in mechanism, but the intention of the NetBeans project to support additional programming languages."
</p>
<p>
The preview version of the NetBeans C/C++ Development Pack allows developers to edit, compile, and build C and C++ applications on multiple operating systems, including Solaris, Linux, and Windows. The preview Pack includes a variety of features to support the C and C++ developer, including editor syntax highlighting, easier code browsing via hyperlinks between invocation and declaration, a makefile wizard, and templates for building C/C++ libraries and applications. The Pack also extends the Netbeans project system to support C and C++ projects and support for multiple project configurations. 
</p>
<p> 
"We use Sun Studio's IDE in development of our popular multi-platform X-Designer software," says Derek Lambert, president and CEO of Imperial Software Technology. "The C/C++ Development Pack makes it possible for us to use open source NetBeans platform for both our C/C++ and Java projects."
</p>
<p> 
Kretsch continues, “The C/C++ Development project is an important initiative for NetBeans. The NetBeans C/C++ Development Pack works seamlessly with the popular NetBeans Mobility Pack and it allows developers to create native embedded applications. With this project, we can leverage the rich set of NetBeans community offerings to further address C/C++ developer's needs.” 
</p>
<p> 
The preview version of NetBeans C/C++ Development Pack 1.0 is available now at http://cnd.netbeans.org.  
</p>
<p>
