<p>SANTA CLARA, Calif. April 27, 2006 � Sun Microsystems, Inc. (Nasdaq: SUNW) today announced plans to support Ricoh Corporation's Embedded Software Architecture Software Development Kit/J (SDK/J) software in the next release of NetBeans(TM) Mobility Pack for CDC. The combination of NetBeans' rich visual development environment and Ricoh's Java(TM) Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME) enabled printer and document management platform, will provide a unique solution for developers in the document management marketplace. Additionally, Sun's commitment to embedded Java and the Java developer community, as evidenced by the NetBeans Mobility Packs, led Ricoh to switch its preferred developer tool from Eclipse and standardize on NetBeans.
</p>
<p>
Sun Microsystems will demonstrate the NetBeans Mobility Pack for CDC at the 2006 Ricoh Developer's Conference on Marco Island, FL. Combining robust project management and an Ant build system, the NetBeans Mobility Pack helps developers for Ricoh products fully leverage the capabilities of the Java platform. Using these tools to build to Java ME standards - supported by Sun and industry leaders like Ricoh - system integrators (SIs) and independent software vendors (ISVs) can bring applications to market simultaneously with new hardware easily and productively.
</p>
<p>"Sun recognizes that developers need complete, specialized solutions for vertical application markets, such as printer and document management," said Jeff Jackson, senior vice president, Java, Enterprise, and Developer software for Sun Microsystems. "Embedded Java technology is a huge growth market and we're happy to be working with industry leaders like Ricoh who embrace it. By combining NetBeans Mobility Pack and the Ricoh SDK/J our companies will  continue to build on the expansion of the robust and growing NetBeans developer community. This cooperative effort demonstrates that NetBeans Mobility is the cutting-edge developer solution for Java ME applications targeting hardware of all shapes and sizes."
</p>
<p>
Ricoh and Sun work together to deliver optimal performance, innovation and value to the customer through joint solutions and innovations. The companies have been collaborating to bring Java technology to the Ricoh developer community for several years, including sponsoring a student developer contests in 2005 and 2006 and fostering numerous community development projects on Java.net. Winners of the 2006 Ricoh and Sun Java Challenge will be announced at the Ricoh Developer�s Conference on April 26. 
</p>
<p>
"Ricoh has selected the NetBeans IDE as the premier development platform for Java application on Ricoh's Aficio(TM) multi-functional products (MFP)," said Mark Minshull, vice president, Solutions Marketing and US Technology Center of Ricoh Corp. "The innovative features, enhanced editor, and out of the box experience of the NetBeans IDE allows Ricoh's developers to accelerate their development time."
</p>
<p>
The NetBeans and Ricoh solution will also be presented at NetBeans Day in San Francisco on May 15, 2006. </p>
<p>
