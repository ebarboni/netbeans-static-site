PALO ALTO, CA. -- March 13, 2000 --  Sun Microsystems, Inc. today announced its plans to release the source code for Forte(TM) for Java[tm], Community Edition 1.0, its cross-platform integrated development environment (IDE) for Java technology. This product will be made available under the Mozilla public licensing model, which is recognized by the open source community as practical and compliant with the Open Source Definition.

<p>This announcement underscores Sun's commitment to open source technologies, and marks the first step in a major new Sun initiative to make Java tools and components available more broadly to drive innovation.</p>

<p>"In a dot-com economy, the developer rules," said Patricia C. Sueltz, president of Software Products and Platforms at Sun Microsystems. "Developers have the power to deliver on two major requirements that determine success in a Web-based world: time to market and business differentiation. Our open tools framework will enable developers to attain new levels of productivity and reliability for dot-com development."</p>

<p>Forte for Java, Community Edition 1.0 is the entry-level product in Sun's Forte for Java product line of Java technology IDEs. The binary code for this product, available at no charge for download through Sun Microsystems, is slated for release by end of month. The source code is targeted to be made available within the next 90 days.</p>

<p>"I applaud Sun's expanding support of the open source movement," said Brian Behlendorf, president of The Apache Software Foundation. "This initiative will make a new generation of development tools and components available to the Java developer community, addressing a huge gap in the market."<p>

<p>"This is encouraging", said Eric Raymond, president of the Open Source Initiative. "I'm happy to see Sun exploring a true open source license."</p>

<p>Today's announcement is the next step in Sun's evolving dot-com development and integration strategy. Forte for Java, Community Edition will form the foundation of Sun's new Java technology-based open tools framework. This framework will support the entire development lifecycle, improve reliability through re-use, eliminate vendor lock-in and dramatically cut costs and time to market.</p>

<p>Based on this open tools framework, Sun, other vendors and the development community at large can collaborate to develop a complete set of interoperable Java components to accelerate the development of dot-com systems. Access to source code provides individual developers, independent software vendors (ISVs) and application providers a new level of control and confidence. It helps ensure that their software will remain open and interoperable with other technologies.</p>

<p>The Forte for Java, Community Edition source code release creates an open community of developers and ISVs to enhance Java technology development tools based on open standards. The Forte for Java, Community Edition source code will also provide the development community with complete access to a core application programming interface (API) from which to develop plug-in modules to enhance the open tools framework.</p>

<p>The Forte for Java, Community Edition 1.0 binary product offers an integrated, extensible, cross-platform development environment for the Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition. This fully modular development environment delivers integrated visual design, editing, compilation and debugging capabilities for development on <a href="http://www.sun.com/solaris">Solaris[tm] Operating Environment</a>, Linux and Microsoft Windows platforms. With more than 200,000 downloads to date, Forte for Java, Community Edition has gained strong adoption among the Java development community participating in the rapid enhancement of this core IDE technology through early access programs. Forte for Java, Community Edition binary product is available at no charge for download through Sun Microsystems, <a href="http://www.sun.com/forte">http://www.sun.com/forte</a>.</p>
