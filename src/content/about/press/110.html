<p>The NetBeans IDE 3.5.1 release contains bug fixes that 
improve the IDE's handling of text when the IDE's default 
font size is increased. These fixes were necessary to 
create a Chinese localization, since the Chinese characters 
require a larger font size to be readable.<p>

<p>Focus of developmemt on the NetBeans IDE 3.5 and 3.5.1 
releases was focused almost entirely on performance. 
Both startup time and general UI responsiveness have 
improved significantly. In addition to that, several 
modules, previously available on the Update Center, have 
been added to the standard distribution. These modules 
provide many features, including support for:
<ul><li>debugging servlets and applications written with JSP 
technology. </li>
<li>creating and editing JSP tag libraries.</li> 
<li>monitoring HTTP requests. </li>
<li>WAR file packaging. </li>
<li>connecting to and browsing databases.</li></ul>

and upgrade instructions can be found in the README file:
