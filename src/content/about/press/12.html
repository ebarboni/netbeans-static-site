SAN FRANCISCO, CA - JavaOneSM Developer Conference -- March 26, 2002 -- Signaling the momentum and breadth of the NetBeansTM open source community, Sun Microsystems, Inc. today announced that at the JavaOne Developer Conference, more than 35 companies will demonstrate NetBeans and ForteTM for JavaTM products and integrations that are "Built on NetBeans" technology. Third-party products range from wireless device emulation software to Web services infrastructure products.

<p>The NetBeans tools platform will celebrate its second anniversary as an open source community in June 2002. Due to its modular architecture and open application programming interfaces (APIs), third parties can easily extend or integrate with the platform to add new functionality. Sun's commercial Forte development products are based on the NetBeans architecture.</p>

<p>At the JavaOne Developer Conference this week, 20 companies will be featured in a "Built on NetBeans" Demonstration Cluster located at the end of aisles 1700-2300, while an additional 15 companies will be demonstrating products in their own booths. This group includes many members of the Forte for Java Extension Partner Program, which assists independent software vendors (ISVs) in extending Sun's Forte for Java product.</p>

<p>"Nearly two years ago, Sun made a commitment to base its commercial Forte for Java product line on the NetBeans open source platform," said Peter Young, vice president, Forte Tools, Sun Microsystems. "The goal was to create a modular open source tools platform that other companies could use as a foundation for their own products, or as a framework that could easily be customized and extended with plug-in modules. Today, that vision has been enthusiastically embraced by the NetBeans and Forte for Java communities. With more than 100 partners building their own products or extending NetBeans technology, NetBeans and Forte for Java have proven to be the validation for the blending of open source and commercial technologies."<p>
