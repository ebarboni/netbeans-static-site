<p><b>SUN'S FORTE FOR JAVA IDE AND NETBEANS DEVELOPER COMMUNITY THRIVE BASED ON THIRD-PARTY INNOVATION</b>
<div class="articledate" style="margin-left:0px;">29 Jan 2002</div>
<p><center><hr width="80%" noshade size="1"></center><p>
SANTA CLARA, Calif., January 29, 2002 � Sun Microsystems, Inc. today announced that a large and growing number of vendors are shipping products or plug-in modules that extend the Forte� for Java[tm] integrated development environment (IDE), a completely standards-based, modular tools product based on the NetBeans� open source platform. By building new plug-ins for the Forte for Java IDE, third-party companies and developers are delivering a wide range of functionality for customers to easily build, assemble, and deploy enterprise applications and services on demand in Sun's Open Net Environment (Sun ONE) and across multiple hardware and software platforms.

<p>The third-party companies providing this enhanced functionality are members of the Forte for Java Extension Partner Program. The program exists to assist these independent software vendors (ISVs) to extend the Forte for Java IDE with unique capabilities. These companies are an extremely valuable asset to the Forte for Java IDE community, making it possible to provide broader development and application solutions by adding innovative technologies and practices to the core product.</p>

<p>"We congratulate these innovative companies that early on recognized the merits of a modular architecture and open source platform for building intelligent tools in the era of services on demand," said Peter Young, vice president, Forte Tools, Sun Microsystems. "Open source developers and partner companies have helped Sun deliver an unprecedented rate of innovation through the Forte for Java IDE. This relationship is mutually beneficial and leads to better quality products for customers, and a more flexible and innovative Java platform for developers."</p>

<p>The success of the Forte for Java Extension Partner Program and the NetBeans community underscores the ongoing momentum that developers are creating around Java language development throughout the industry, and stands in stark contrast to the closed, proprietary approach taken by other vendors. The NetBeans community, now in its eighteenth month of existence, continues to experience explosive growth as a vibrant catalyst for developer innovation. The Netbeans open source project has several thousand registered particpants representing more than 1200 different organizations.<p>

<p>"Sun's dual strategy, leveraging its commercial products as well as open source efforts, fosters an atmosphere of rapid innovation and collaboration," said Cathy Lippert, director, Product Management, Compuware Corporation. "Our OptimalJ product, built on NetBeans, is a perfect example. The solution accelerates application delivery by simplifying Java technology development, enabling developers of varying experience levels to rapidly produce reliable J2EE business applications."</p>

<p>Forte for Java, Enterprise Edition
Forte for Java, release 3.0, Enterprise Edition (www.sun.com/forte) supports and dramatically simplifies application development that uses Java 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE�) technologies, such as Enterprise JavaBean� (EJB�) components. The IDE is a core component of Sun ONE, is built on NetBeans, supports deployment to leading J2EE application servers, and has been optimized specifically for Sun's iPlanet� Application Server 6.0 to enable developers to target their applications for maximum performance, scalability and availability.</p>

<p>Third Party Providers Shipping Product
Third party ISVs focus on adding unique features and capabilities to the Forte for Java IDE, contributing their expertise in areas such as wireless development, modeling, lifecycle management and other technologies.</p>

<p>The following partners are currently shipping stand-alone products or plug-in modules that can be integrated with the Forte for Java IDE:</p>

</p>Compuware (<a href="http://www.compuware.com">www.compuware.com</a>) - Compuware OptimalJ provides a simple and easy, yet powerful way to write distributed Java applications without involving developers in the details of the J2EE architecture. Less experienced Java language developers can quickly build or modify business applications, while advanced developers are freed from many repetitive coding tasks and can focus on architecture refinements and customization.</p>

<p>Embarcadero Technologies (<a href="http://www.embarcadero.com">www.embarcadero.com</a>) - Embarcadero's Describe is a robust UML design tool that functions stand-alone or fully integrated within the Forte for Java IDE.
