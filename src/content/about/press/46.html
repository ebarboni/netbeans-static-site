PRAGUE, Czech Republic--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Oct. 26, 1998--NetBeans Inc. today announced the release of NetBeans Developer 2.0, one of the first full-featured Java IDEs based on Java Foundation Classes (JFC).

<p>The culmination of more than three months of beta testing, the release marks an important new entrant into the Java technology tool arena.</p>

<p>NetBeans Developer 2.0 is a programming tool for software developers who want to design and build powerful, cross-platform applications - on any platform. NetBeans was designed for the Java platform and is one of the first comprehensive IDEs with sophisticated support for visual development of JFC applications. It is an industrial-strength development tool that is easy to learn and intuitive to operate.</p>

<p>"Because NetBeans Developer 2.0 is based on JavaBeans technology, tremendous power is put into the hands of the developer to customize the environment or add components as needed," commented Dr. Lew Tucker, director of Developer Relations at Sun Microsystems' Java Software. "NetBeans is breaking new ground."</p>

<p>"In addition to breaking new ground in Java technology," added NetBeans' Founder/CEO Roman Stanek, "we're also providing a springboard for software developers to reach that new ground with us. NetBeans is the perfect entry tool for programming in the Java language, and developers who use it will always be at the forefront of the Java technology curve. NetBeans Developer 2.0 is also an entry point to Enterprise computing. Our next product, a team programming platform, will build on this edition and will incorporate numerous additional advanced Java technology features."</p>

<p>Product overview</p>

<p>NetBeans Developer 2.0 is a full-featured, cross-platform Java technology IDE. NetBeans combines support for all stages of application development including visual design, coding, compiling, and debugging in a comprehensive visual programming package.</p>

<p>It runs on all platforms that support JDK™ 1.1.x, including Windows 95/98/NT, Linux, Solaris™, HP-UX, OS/2, AIX, SGI Irix, Mac and others. Professional developers will appreciate its full complement of features, its wide range of controls, and its flexibility.</p>

<p>The IDE is based on JFC and JavaBeans Components, and all parts of the IDE are actually themselves JavaBeans. The result is an IDE where the user can fully customize the interface, modify component behavior and easily add new components. NetBeans is built to be extended and will offer APIs for users to create their own modules.</p>

<p>Christian Gamrat, a development engineer with a French government research agency, praised NetBeans' stability and ease of use. "I tried it on a Sun UltraSparc and it's by far the best IDE for Java I've seen on this platform. NetBeans Form builder is really great, and the generated code is simple and clean. I also liked the connection wizard, which makes using all sorts of beans very easy. I was able to execute all my small test applications without any problems (the 1st time since I'm in Java land!) I also liked the way you deal with layouts - it's very intuitive and clean."</p>

<p>Features</p>

<p>This release of NetBeans Developer 2.0 includes the NetBeans development environment, full documentation in several formats, four tutorials for new NetBeans users, and a bundled JavaBeans component from KL Group, Jclass Chart Lite.
