<b>NetBeans Mobility Pack Provides Open Source Framework for Mobile Java Development Tools</b>

<p>SANTA CLARA, CALIF. August 23rd, 2006 Sun Microsystems, Inc. (Nasdaq: SUNW), the creator and leading advocate of Java technology, today announced the availability of source code for NetBeans(TM) Mobility Pack and NetBeans Mobility Pack for CDC (Connected
Device Configuration), which will be released under the OSI-compliant Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL). Java ME development tools represent the cutting edge in mobile Java development and boasts unique visual authoring features that can simplify and speed the creation of applications for the vast majority of mobile devices. Developers, tool vendors, mobile operators and device manufacturers can get involved in the open source project immediately. On the Net: <a href="http://mobility.netbeans.org">http://mobility.netbeans.org</a>.

<p>"Community involvement is key to the strength of the NetBeans
platform," said Laurie Tolson, vice president, Java Developer Platforms
Group, Sun Microsystems. "We are experiencing continued excitement for some
of the industry's most innovative mobile developer products. We believe by
open- sourcing the code, it will attract even more developers to embrace
the platform; thus strengthening the community."</p>

<p>The NetBeans Mobility Pack was quickly recognized as a leading mobile
IDE and has been leveraged by Java ME developers and leaders including
Sprint, SonyEricsson and Ricoh. Based on the NetBeans IDE, the Mobility
Pack includes key features including end-to-end application development,
device optimization and porting solutions and an Ant-based build system.
With a highly customizable and open platform, the Mobility Pack is a great
productivity enhancer for developers new to Java ME or those with years of
experience.</p>
<p>NetBeans Mobility Pack for CDC is a new addition to the NetBeans
portfolio. The Mobility Pack for CDC allows Java ME developers to use the
Matisse graphical layout system to create mobile Java applications for
devices supporting the Connected Device Configuration version of Java ME,
which offers a more powerful programming and runtime environment.</p>
