<b>New Release Improves Developer Productivity, Eases Deployment and Simplifies Plug-In Development</b>

<p><b>SANTA CLARA, Calif. - February 2, 2006 - Sun Microsystems Inc. (Nasdaq:SUNW), the creator and leading advocate of Java technology, together with the NetBeans community today announced the general availability of the Java based open-source NetBeans Integrated Development Environment (IDE) software tools via download at www.netbeans.org. NetBeans 5.0 IDE provides comprehensive support for building Java SE, Java EE, and Java ME applications and includes a variety of unique new features and significant enhancements such as NetBeans GUI Builder (formerly Project Matisse), that differentiates it from all other developer tools.</b>

<p>Other features of the release include: completely redesigned support for CVS; support for the Sun Java System AppServer 8.2; BEA WebLogic 9 and JBoss 4 application servers; Struts and Java Server Faces support and new types of re-factoring and editor enhancements that make writing code even easier than before.</p>

<p>"Project Matisse epitomizes the finest qualities of the Java desktop renaissance. No other tool I have tried makes it so easy to "get it right" in the design of of a Java GUI, and the code it generates is both clean and comprehensible," says Rick Ross, JavaLobby. "Don't waste your time doing layouts by hand, Matisse is the power tool you've needed all along."</p>

<p>"The NetBeans IDE is another example of the tremendous momentum Sun is experiencing with it open source initiatives," said Jeff Jackson, senior vice president of Java, Enterprise, and Developer platforms for Sun. "During the last 18 months the community has seen a tripling of active users of NetBeans -- and we expect that momentum to skyrocket with the launch of NetBeans 5." </p>

<p>Among the new features in NetBeans 5, easy to use tools for quickly extending the IDE or building a rich client application on the NetBeans Platform that have already been adopted by by a variety of leading industry technologies and companies. NetBeans 5.0 ensures the common look and feel of applications post-deployment across the following platforms which support Java SE: the <a href="http://www.sun.com/solaris/">Solaris 10 Operating System</a>, OpenSolaris, Linux, Microsoft Windows, and Apple Macintosh OS X.</p>

<p>And introduced for the first time, Technical Support for NetBeans will now be available through the <a href="http://developers.sun.com/developer_help/">Expert Assistance</a> - a new Sun Developer Network Program. Through this program, a developer can get assistance for Sun developer tools, the Java SE platform and NetBeans IDE. Diagnostic and coding advice, workarounds, and best practices guidance are all available free while this support program is in Beta.</p>

<p>Jackson continues, "With the expansion of the NetBeans IDE user-base, and the comprehensive support available for plug-in development with NetBeans 5, the industry is already lining up behind NetBeans as the premier tool for delivering solutions to the Java developer community."

<p>Also being released, NetBeans Mobility Pack 5 -- the much anticipated industry-leading tool for developing applications targeted at the 200 billion-plus Java ME powered mobile devices currently offered by industry leaders.

<p>"The NetBeans Mobility Pack 5 is a great solution for Java ME application creation for Sony Ericsson phones. Now developers can build end-to-end applications for mobile phones such as the Sony Ericsson W550, W600 and W900 Walkman(R) phones and the P990 smartphone supporting the MIDP Web Services API (JSR-172)," said Ulf Wretling, director and head of Content Development at Sony Ericsson. "On-device debugging and deployment to Sony Ericsson phones, plus the Mobility Pack's drag-and-drop authoring capabilities make this a must-have tool for the productive mobile developer."

<p>Sun has committed to open sourcing its entire software portfolio using industry-standard open source licensing models to allow customers to have easy and broad access to all of its source code. Many of the components of Sun's integrated platform are already available as open source, including the Solaris OS, the Sun Java Application Server, and several key underlying services like single sign-on capabilities and the ability to connect multiple, independent applications in a standard way. This is a trend where Sun continues to be a pioneer.
