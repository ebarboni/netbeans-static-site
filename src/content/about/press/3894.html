<b> SANTA CLARA, CALIF. September 6, 2006 Sun Microsystems, Inc. (Nasdaq: SUNW), the creator and leading advocate of Java technology, today announced the general availability of an installation program that bundles the NetBeans IDE and the JBoss Application Server. The installer is available for Solaris, GNU/Linux, OS X, and Windows operating systems.</b>

<p>As the primary sponsor of the NetBeans open source project, Sun worked with JBoss, a division of Red Hat, to create an installer that includes the NetBeans IDE and the JBoss Application Server in one bundle. This will allow developers to do a single installation and then immediately begin developing Java EE applications.</p>

<p>"The NetBeans IDE works right out of the box. By providing an installer that includes the JBoss Application Server, we can further improve the productivity of the large cross-section of our customers and developer community that uses JBoss," said Laurie Tolson, vice president of Java Developer Products at Sun.</p>

<p>"The NetBeans IDE and JBoss Application Server bundle is another step forward in offering our customers choice and simplicity when it comes to developing standards-based Java EE applications," said Shaun Connolly, vice president of product management, JBoss. "The NetBeans team has done a great job on the plug-in for the NetBeans IDE that provides developers with the tools for doing development with JBoss Application Server. We're pleased to work with Sun to enhance developer productivity." </p>
