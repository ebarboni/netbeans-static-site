Reston, VA � 05/15/2006 -- Sprint (NYSE: S) today announced the availability of the Sprint Wireless Toolkit 3.0 and Sprint Mobility IDE for members of the Sprint Developer Program. Continuing its commitment to Java� Platform Micro Edition (Java ME) and mobile data, this customized tool solution is optimized for the Sprint portfolio of devices and their Java ME platform APIs and capabilities, enabling developers to rapidly and efficiently deliver mobile Java ME technology applications such as the Sprint Music Store� and other multimedia applications to the entire Sprint customer base.
</p>

<p>
"Sprint is dedicated to meeting the ever-increasing customer demand for mobility services," said Paul Reddick, vice president, business development and product innovation, Sprint. "Offering developers a one-stop solution for bringing innovative content and applications to our network allows customers access to a vast portfolio of multimedia content. Our commitment to wireless data and Java has been unwavering since we launched our first Java-technology enabled device in 1999."
</p>
<p>
Based on the award-winning Sun Java Wireless Toolkit and NetBeans products, this solution provides an out-of-the-box experience that provides Java ME technology developers the tools they need to build innovative applications for the Sprint network. Drag-and-drop design, including specific preconfigured Sprint components, highlights the feature set of the Sprint Mobility IDE. Templates, samples and a preprocessing solution simplify the challenge of optimizing applications for the entire Sprint portfolio. The Sprint Wireless Toolkit offers emulation for almost all devices in the Sprint portfolio and supports Sprint-specific APIs, and a number of JSRs, plus MIDP 1.0 and 2.0. Both the Toolkit and the Mobility IDE are compatible with other IDEs and device emulators, allowing developers to expand the environment to whatever their specific needs require.
</p>
<p>
"Sprint has been an important partner for Sun as we have brought Java ME technology to consumers on more than 1 billion devices," said Alan Brenner, vice president, Client Systems Group, Sun Microsystems. "Developers are critical to the success of the Java ME platform, and using our innovative developer products to tailor a solution specifically for Sprint's leading edge network is a win-win for everyone."
