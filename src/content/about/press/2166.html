Milestone 11 for Optimized Java Application Run-Time 
Monitoring</b></center>

<p><b>NetBeans Profiler Provides Tighter Control During the 
Development Process; Supports Java SE 5 Applications on 
Leading Platforms Including New Support for Mac OS X</b></p>

<p>MENLO PARK, Calif., Dec. 13 - Sun Microsystems Inc.
(Nasdaq: <a href="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=prnewswire&PageName=QUOTE&Ticker=SUNW">SUNW</a>), 
the creator and leading advocate of Java technology, today 
announced NetBeans Profiler Milestone 11, the latest release 
of its high-performance Java application profiler, and an 
add-on to the upcoming open source NetBeans IDE release 5. 
Application profilers are crucial to building reliable, 
scalable applications as they provide information about the 
run-time behavior of applications. The new version of the 
NetBeans Profiler will help optimize the Java application 
development process by providing tighter run-time monitoring 
of CPU, memory, and threads, in addition to new early access 
support for the Mac OS X.</p>

<p>As a collaboration between Sun's research arm and its open 
source NetBeans Software team, the Profiler is add-on 
technology to the NetBeans integrated development 
environment, which serves as the foundation of development 
tools for both the Java Enterprise System (JES) and Solaris 
Enterprise System (SES). The NetBeans Profiler has been 
architected from the outset to deliver low-overhead 
profiling, tight integration with the Java platform, and 
support for profiling of all types of applications: desktop, 
web, and enterprise. In addition to early access support 
for Java profiling on Mac OS X, the latest release of the 
NetBeans Profiler provides continued support for Java 
Platform, Standard Edition 5 (Java SE 5) applications 
running on the Solaris Operating System (OS), Windows 
and Linux.</p>

<p>The NetBeans Profiler is based on profiling technology 
originally developed in Sun Laboratories. This technology 
uses dynamic bytecode instrumentation to allow for profiling 
with dramatically lower overhead, giving the ability to 
obtain results in situations where the use of other 
profilers becomes unpractical or impossible. Profiling an 
example application from the Java SE 5 JDK, the NetBeans 
Profiler imposed only 10% of the overhead of traditional 
Java profilers.</p>

<p>"The key challenges facing Java developers trying to 
improve performance in their applications are that 
traditional profilers introduce excessive overhead and 
overwhelm developers with too much information," says Tim 
Cramer, Director of NetBeans Engineering. "We have enhanced 
the developer workflow by adding the profiler capability to 
the NetBeans IDE. Now developers can edit, compile, debug, 
test and profile leading to more robust applications."</p>

<p>The NetBeans IDE has seen significant increases in user 
adoption over the last 18 months. Release 5 of the NetBeans 
IDE, scheduled for early 2006, will accelerate that trend by 
providing additional unique feature enhancements: code aware 
developer collaboration, a new visual GUI development tool 
(Project Matisse), leading edge tools for developing mobile 
applications, and the NetBeans Profiler. Adding the profiler 
to the mix of tools available to the developer in the 
NetBeans IDE, enhances developer workflow, changing the 
model from edit/compile/test/debug to 
edit/compile/test/debug/profile, leading to more robust 
applications.</p>

<p>In addition to this momentum with IDE features, and users, 
the NetBeans Platform has seen increased interest and 
support among industry partners, including one of Sun's 
newest acquisitions, SeeBeyond.</p>

<p>"Long before SeeBeyond joined forces with Sun, it supported 
the NetBeans Platform," says Jerry Waldorf, Chief Architect 
of the Integration Platform, Sun Microsystems. "Several 
years ago, SeeBeyond chose to build its toolset on the 
NetBeans Platform, because of the extensibility and 
ease-of-use. The SeeBeyond Integration Products require a 
high performance, fully featured platform that can integrate 
seamlessly with the offering. The NetBeans Platform 
continues to deliver that and more."</p>
