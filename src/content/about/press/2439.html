SANTA CLARA, Calif., Jan. 26 /PRNewswire/ -- Sun 
Microsystems Inc. (Nasdaq: SUNW), the creator and
leading 
advocate of Java technology, today announced that
Project 
Matisse -- the Graphical User Interface Builder and
one of 
the most innovative features of the highly anticipated

NetBeans 5.0 Integrated development Environment (IDE) 
software -- is achieving broad developer adoption and 
endorsements.</b><br />
</p>
 
<p>With NetBeans 5.0, the Graphical User Interface
(GUI) 
Builder is dramatically simplified, which enables
users to 
speed up their developmentcycle. This optimization has

already demonstrated itself to be a major advancement
in the 
creation of rich client Java applications. For
example,
Serpro, Brazil's largest public IT company, recently
began 
using NetBeans Project Matisse to develop Java
applications 
for a range of Federal agencies in Brazil. With close
to 
9000 employees in over 300 cities, Serpro impressively

manages more than 1 billion transactions annually for
the
Brazilian government.</p>

<p>According to Serge Rehem, chief of development at
Serpro, 
"We are committed to open source in platforms and
tools, and 
NetBeans is one of our development tools of choice.
NetBeans 
solves the problem that has been plaguing developers
for 
years -- easy GUI creation. There is nothing else like
it in 
the market today and our Java desktop developers are
now 
switching to NetBeans."</p>

<p>In contrast with other visual development tools
that 
target rich client development on specific platforms, 
Project Matisse is unique in building applications
that can 
be deployed -- with consistent look, feel, and user
interaction -- across the variety of desktop platforms
that 
support Java SE, using simple drag and drop
technology. 
These include the Solaris 10 OS, OpenSolaris, Linux, 
Microsoft Windows and Apple Macintosh OS X.</p>

<p>To date, there have been more than 8 million
downloads of 
the NetBeans IDE (approximately 30 percent of those in
the 
past year.) Overall, developers are making the switch
to 
NetBeans from other development tools, recognizing the
improved power and speed provided by the NetBeans IDE.

NetBeans, see

<p>Over the past 12 months, we've broken down the
barricades 
to easy Java development," says Jeff Jackson, senior
vice 
president of Java, Enterprise and Development Products
at 
Sun. "What's more, we've accomplished it all while
adhering to the core values of the Java platform --
cross 
platform application development and deployment with
Java 
standards. We're pleased to see organizations like
Serpro 
eagerly anticipating the release of NetBeans 5.0."</p>
