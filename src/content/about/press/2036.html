MENLO PARK, Calif., Dec. 6 - Sun Microsystems Inc.
(Nasdaq: <a href="http://studio.financialcontent.com/Engine?Account=prnewswire&PageName=QUOTE&Ticker=SUNW">SUNW</a>), the creator and leading advocate of Java (TM) technology,
today announced the NetBeans(TM) WorldTour, an initiative for distributing and
sharing the NetBeans software worldwide. With 10 global developer events
planned from Canada to South Africa, the NetBeans WorldTour will offer
developers a chance to experience first hand the full featured, modular,
extensible and award winning Integrated Developer Environment (IDE) that can
accelerate Java development across all platforms. NetBeans' is a fast and full
functioning IDE that supports the creation of Java Enterprise Edition, Java
Mobile Edition and Java Standard Edition applications.

<p>In addition, Sun has created the NetBeans WorldTour CD program, which
provides any developer around the world who registers with the Sun Developer
Network (SDN), a free NetBeans software CD with free shipping and handling. By
shipping the latest NetBeans technology to all SDN registered users and by
hosting a number of developer events around the world, Sun is keeping
developers on the cutting edge of Java technology.

<p>"NetBeans IDE is 100% Java and the most comprehensive development tool on
the market. Only NetBeans software allows you to create enterprise, mobile and
web applications with one single tool," said John Loiacono, executive vice
president of Software at Sun Microsystems. "We are removing all barriers that
might exist so developers can have immediate access to NetBeans software and
start creating Java applications quickly, easily, and at no cost."

<p>The NetBeans WorldTour CD currently includes the NetBeans IDE 4.1, the Sun
Java System Application Server 8.1 Platform Edition, the NetBeans Mobility
Pack 4.1 and the NetBeans Profiler. It is available from:
<a href="http://www.netbeans.org/about/cd-form.html" target="_new">http://www.netbeans.org/about/cd-form.html</a> and will be updated as major
enhancements and new releases become available.

<p>"We started the free NetBeans WorldTour CD program because we wanted to
share the excitement -- regardless of bandwidth or location -- and we are
delighted at the explosive growth and success it has achieved," said
Jeff Jackson, senior vice president, Java Enterprise Developer Products and
Platforms Group at Sun Microsystems. "We have already shipped over 11,500 CDs
to over 100 different countries."

<p>Organized around Sun Tech Days
(<a href="http://developers.sun.com/events/techdays/" target="_new">http://developers.sun.com/events/techdays/</a> ), the live NetBeans WorldTour
events provide developers around the world the opportunity to hear from Sun
experts and experience first-hand other innovative technologies and
developments at Sun. And with the anticipation building for the release of
NetBeans 5.0, the NetBeans Software WorldTour includes demonstrations of the
highly-acclaimed Project Matisse GUI Builder -- a key feature of the upcoming
release -- and the NetBeans Collaboration module, supporting in-context
collaborative development for programmers world-wide.
