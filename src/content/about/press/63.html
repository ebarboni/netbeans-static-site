NetBeans 3.4 offers improved performance and new features
to help YOU be more productive.

<p><b>Features</b><ul>

<li>Pop-up Javadoc documentation - NetBeans' already excellent code completion now displays documentation for classes as you navigate them, resulting in fewer missteps
     during development.</li>

<li>Live parsing and error marking - syntactical and semantic
     errors are highlighted as you type.  Where before you might need
     to recompile to find simple typos and minor errors, you now
     get instant feedback.</li>

<li>Completely redesigned debugger user interface.</li>

<li>New editor toolbar for fast navigation to class members
     and easy access to powerful editor features.</li>

<li>Drag and drop support - drag tabs between windows to customize
     your desktop (JDK 1.4.1 only on
     Windows); drag tree nodes such as methods and fields
     between classes and more.</li>

<li>Windowing system improvements to use screen space more
     efficiently.</li>

<li>Close buttons on tabs in the editor and elsewhere.</li></ul></p>



<p>You also get all of the features you've already come to expect
in NetBeans, such as CVS support, code completion, JSP & Servlet,
CORBA, RMI, JDBC support, and support for multiple JDKs.</p>

<p>The new module catalogue is also available</p>
