SAN FRANCISCO, CA ñ March 4, 2002 ñ Fresher Information Corporation, today announced it will integrate its Matisse database with Sun Microsystem's Forte‘ for Java‘ integrated development environment (IDE). The Matisse Link/Forte for Java software will provide customers, for the first time, with the ability to work entirely within the object paradigm to reduce development time and increase the efficiency and performance of their Java language applications.

<p>In addition, Fresher has joined the Forte for Java Extension Partner Program, providing Fresher with an introduction to one of the largest Java technology communities. The program assists independent software vendors (ISVs) in extending the Forte for Java IDE with complementary products, providing customers with a broader choice of innovative technologies that build on the core IDE.</p>

<p>Fresher chose to align with the Forte for Java technology to provide developers with an integrated object solution for their Java language application and database development. With the Matisse Link/Forte for Java software, developers can streamline their development process by using the Forte for Java environment to define their Matisse database schema, generate database classes and directly map objects to classes, without leaving the IDE.</p>

<p>"Fresher's partnership with Forte will help us deliver products that will make it easier for our customers to build and deploy Java technology applications," said Kal Krishnan, Fresher's vice president of engineering. "The combination of Matisse and the Forte for Java IDE eliminates the complexities and inefficiencies of the object-relational mapping layer required by relational and object relational databases."</p>

<p>"Fresher has been a leading innovator in developing database technology," said Arthur Gould, Manager of Business Development, Developer Web Services, Sun Microsystems. <b>"This latest product brings that expertise to Java language developers through its Matisse database integration link, which will save developers time and effort. Fresher's integration with the Forte for Java IDE is yet another example of the vibrant developer community building on the NetBeansô platform."</b></p>

<p>A preview version of the Matisse Link/Forte for Java software will be available later this month. For more information about Matisse, or to download the free developer version, visit <a href="http://www.fresher.com">www.fresher.com</a>.</p>
