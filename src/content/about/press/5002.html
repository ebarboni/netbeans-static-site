<b>Sun supports GNU/Linux community by distributing a complete Java stack, including NetBeans, packaged for Ubuntu 7.04</b>

<p><b>SANTA CLARA, Calif. April 19, 2007 Sun Microsystems, Inc. (Nasdaq: SUNW) and Canonical Ltd., today announced the immediate availability of a complete, production quality Java technology stack and developer tools with the latest release of Ubuntu, v7.04, making it easier for GNU/Linux developers to leverage the Java platform in their applications. This stack, which is comprised of key popular Java technologies such as GlassFish v1 (the open source Java Platform, Enterprise Edition 5 implementation), Java Platform, Standard Edition (JDK 6), Java DB 10.2 (built from Apache Derby) and NetBeans IDE 5.5 -- will be available in the Multiverse component of the Ubuntu repository on April 19. These technologies will be available for Ubuntu users to install easily over the network with apt-get and other standard software management tools.</b></p>

<p>"Sun and Canonical are working together to bring the full power of the Java platform in a fully integrated and easy to install fashion to the free and open source software communities," said Ian Murdock, chief operating systems officer, Sun. "Sun is committed to open source and will continue to promote transparency in software development by facilitating creation of innovative technology with the help of the developer community."</p>

<p>"Packaging NetBeans and Java for Ubuntu ensures that we are able to distribute it efficiently to the huge community of Ubuntu users," said Mark Shuttleworth, founder of Ubuntu. "Developers who are interested in Sun's latest Java technology can install it instantly if they are running Ubuntu. As Java components are released under free software licenses, we will consider these components for inclusion in the core of Ubuntu."</p>

<p>Sun is committed to supporting developers by providing versions of its technologies that are optimized and accessible by the various open source GNU/Linux and OpenSolaris communities. Commercial support for all of these components, which are also supplied with Sun's Solaris Operating System, is available at <a href="http://www.sun.com/software/linux/developer.xml">http://www.sun.com/software/linux/developer.xml</a></p>

<p>More information on the work involved in packaging these applications for inclusion in Ubuntu will be presented at this year's JavaOne Conference in San Francisco during session TS-7361, by Harpreet Singh of Sun and Jeff Bailey of Canonical entitled "Packaging Java Platform Applications into Ubuntu". Other related JavaOne events are Ian Murdock's talk on "Linux vs Solaris?" at CommunityOne and an entire new Open Source Track that will cover Sun's Free/Open Source Java software strategy in depth, starting with Simon Phipps' talk TS-7498, "Liberating Java: Free and Open Opportunity for the Future."</p>
