<b>New release marks latest milestone from NetBeans Community: Support for PHP and a Python Preview</b>

<p><b>SUN TECH DAYS - BEIJING, China - November 19, 2008 - Sun Microsystems, Inc. (NASDAQ: JAVA) and the NetBeans(TM) community today announced the imminent release of the NetBeans Integrated Development Environment (IDE) 6.5. This release provides an intuitive and feature-rich IDE for PHP and increased support for Web and Java(TM) software development. In addition, NetBeans 6.5 will include fully localized versions of simplified Chinese, Japanese and Brazilian Portuguese. <a href="http://www.netbeans.org">Click here to download</a>.</b>

<p>In addition, the community is releasing an early access version for Python applications. Early access includes an editor, debugger and choice of Python runtimes. Community members are invited to join the project and provide feedback.</p>

<p>"Integration across multiple languages simplifies development. The NetBeans IDE 6.5 allows you to stay within one tool and move easily from PHP to JavaScript and back. It's all about making developers more productive," said Ian Murdock, vice president, Developer and Community Marketingâ€¨ at Sun.</p>

<p>"If I had known about NetBeans for PHP a few days earlier, I wouldn't have wanted or needed to renew the licenses of our current PHP IDE. NetBeans is so much faster, smaller and much more usable," said Holger Meyer, head of research and development, webEdition and creator of MAMP.</p>

<p>"In the development arena, mixed language programming is becoming the norm. We needed our tools to be in one place, by adding the early access version of Python to the NetBeans project, we can accomplish our development in a more productive manner," said Allan Davis, lead developer, nbPython. "Working with Sun on this project has been an incredible experience for me. The engineers are top notch and the NetBeans community has been a blessing and an inspiration to get the project to this point. I am glad to be a part of such a great product."</p>

<p>The NetBeans IDE 6.5 release includes the following highlights:
<ul>
<li>Feature-rich tooling for PHP such as syntax highlighting, code completion, code generators, debugging, database wizards, and FTP support</li>
<li>An editor for JavaScript(TM) development, including CSS/HTML code completion, the ability to debug client-side JavaScript code within both Firefox and Microsoft Internet Explorer browsers.</li>
<li>Enhanced support for Spring, Hibernate, Java Server Pages, Java Persistence API</li>
<li>Multithreaded debugging for Java technologies</li>
<li>Support for Groovy and Grails in the editor </li>
<li>Ruby enhancements within the editor, debugger and Rake</li>
</ul>

Sun also offers a tiered set of developer support services for its software offerings, ranging from single incident to comprehensive developer plans. Beginning mid-December, Sun will introduce the Sun Certified Specialist for NetBeans IDE, a new training and certification program. Achieving certification provides clear evidence that the programmer has passed stringent testing criteria, which allows employers and customers to readily identify programmers who have in-depth experience and proficiency to develop Java technology-based desktop and Web applications using the NetBeans IDE.</p>

<p>In addition, with a broad portfolio of training and certification offerings, developers can enhance their skill sets to take advantage of cutting-edge technologies. The training helps to enable programmers to become proficient in Java technology while gaining experience using an IDE.
