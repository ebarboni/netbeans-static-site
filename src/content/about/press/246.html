<center>NetBeans Release 4.0 Includes Performance Profiler and
Refactoring Based on Technology from Jackpot Project</center>

<p><b>SAN FRANCISCO - 2004 JavaOne(sm) Conference - June 29,
 2004</b> - Sun Microsystems, Inc. (Nasdaq: SUNW), 
the creator and leading advocate of Java(tm) technology, 
today announced release 4.0 of the NetBeans(tm) project. 
The NetBeans 4.0 IDE will have the capability to develop 
full Java 2 Platform Enterprise Edition (J2EE(tm)) 
applications, including support for Enterprise JavaBeans(tm) 
(EJB(tm)) technology and Web services, as well as mobile 
development support. Other release 4.0 highlights include 
a new Java technology performance profiler based on 
patent-pending technology originally developed at Sun Labs 
and refactoring capabilities based on Dr. James Gosling's 
Jackpot project.</p>

<p>These new capabilities represent a contribution by Sun 
of approximately 350,000 lines of code valued at $14 
million from its commercial Sun(tm) Java(tm) Studio 
Standard integrated development environment (IDE) to the 
NetBeans open source project (www.netbeans.org). </p>

<p>Sun made these announcements at the inaugural NetBeans 
Software Day, a gathering of NetBeans developers and 
partners being held today in conjunction with the 2004 
JavaOne Conference. The NetBeans Day features a keynote by 
Dr. James Gosling, chief technology officer for the 
Developer Platforms Group at Sun.

<p>"The NetBeans Software Day is the best place in the 
world to be for every member of the NetBeans community, 
from partner organizations to NetBeans contributors," said 
Gosling. "We're learning about the latest developments in 
the NetBeans version 4.0 software and sharing knowledge, 
ideas and insights that will lead to even more innovation 
in open source computing with Java technology."</p>

<p>The keynote will feature the upcoming 4.0, release which 
is expected to be available in Beta by the end of July. 
Representatives from leading companies including AccuRev, 
Enerjy, HiT Software, HP, InsiTech, Iopsis Software, Ivis 
Technologies, Nexaweb, Nuance, RefactorIT, MAKE 
Technologies and Quest Software will give presentations on 
their use of NetBeans technology.</p>

<p><b>NetBeans Project Now Delivers Full J2EE Technology 
Development Capabilities</b><br>
With Sun's contribution of the capability to develop J2EE 
technology applications, NetBeans now spans the full range 
of Java technology development � from mobility, to desktop, 
to Web services � with one open source IDE. Building on the 
existing JavaServer(tm) Pages software, Java servlet 
extension and JSR-45 compliant Java Standard Tag Library 
support, NetBeans now supports full J2EE technology 
development capabilities including EJB components. When 
combined with the Java Web Services Developer Pack and a 
deployment runtime like the Sun(tm) Java(tm) System 
Application Server (a component of the Sun(tm) Java(tm) 
Enterprise System) NetBeans provides the ideal IDE for 
secure, interoperable Web services.</p>

<p><b>Performance Profiling Technology Added to NetBeans</b><br> 
The new NetBeans profiler project will allow developers 
easy access to CPU and memory usage data.</p>

<p>"Performance profiling tools are a critical piece to the 
overall development process for large Java technology 
applications," said Steve Wilson, engineering director for 
NetBeans technology and lead author of the book <i>Java 
Platform Performance</i>. "By making a set of state-of-the 
art performance tools available at zero cost, deeply 
integrated into the IDE, we will allow thousands of 
developers to take full advantage of the Java platform."</p>

<p><b>NetBeans 4.0 Software Preview</b>
Gosling also is expected to demonstrate the forthcoming 4.0 
release at the event. Technology from the Jackpot project 
will serve as the basis for NetBeans' new refactoring 
features, which will help provide simplified code 
maintenance for developers. Technology from Sun Labs will 
also provide a foundation for the next-generation source 
code analysis and transformation features that will be 
included in future releases of the NetBeans project.</p>

<p>For mobile developers, release 4.0 will provide 
expanded support for Java(tm) 2 Platform Micro Edition 
(J2ME(tm)), including Mobile Information Device Profile 
(MIDP) 2.0 and Connected Limited Device Configuration (CLDC) 
1.1, and support for the J2ME Wireless Toolkit (WTK) 2.2.</p> 

<p>The J2ME Wireless Toolkit 2.2 software Beta version, 
with new APIs, is available today 
(<a href="http://java.sun.com/" target=_blank">http://java.sun.com/</a>). 
The award-winning toolkit provides Java technology 
developers with the emulation environment, documentation 
and examples needed to develop mobile Java applications for 
mobile information devices such as cellular phones and 
entry-level PDAs.</p>

<p>The J2ME Wireless Toolkit implements impressive 
capabilities that are exposed through standard APIs as 
defined through the Java Community Process(sm) (JCP(sm)). 
The new J2ME Web Services APIs (JSR 172) let J2ME devices 
act as Web services clients, simplifying the extension of 
enterprise applications to the mobile workforce. Other new 
APIs included in the Wireless Toolkit 2.2 beta version are:
<li>Wireless Messaging API (WMA) 2.0 (JSR 205)
<li>Mobile 3D Graphics API for J2ME (JSR 184)
<li>PDA Optional Packages for the J2ME Platform (JSR 75)
<li>Java APIs for Bluetooth (JSR 82)</li></p>
