In addition, Sun is providing this enhanced web services development for Web Services with the NetBeans(TM) 5.0 IDE - bundled with the Sun Java System Application Server, Platform Edition - to enable developers to speedily implement, debug and deploy web services.

<p> 
"The Web Services Developer Pack has been a popular favorite with developers through several releases now," according tosaid Jeff Jackson, Senior VP senior vice president of Java, Enterprise and Developer Tools,  at Sun Microsystems.  "This latest release continues to deliver breakthrough technology for developing Web Services applications - giving developers a head start on some major enhancements in service oriented architectures."
</p>
 <p>
The Java WSDP is, as part of the open source GlassFish project, is a freely available  integrated toolkit  that developers can use to build, test and deploy web services with the latest web service technologies and standards implementations. The latest release of this popular download provides benefits from a variety of innovations: 
  </p>
<ul>
<li>Use next-generation XML and Web services technologies slated for inclusion into Sun's industry-standard Java deployment platforms.</li>
<li>EEnhance web services performance without revising WSDL files or application code thanks to updated Fast Infoset features.</li>
<li>Provide greater web services application security features with enhanced XWSS technologies.</li>
<li>Continue to enjoy Java interoperability and portability across platforms and devices, including those from Sun and other vendors.</li>
<li>Simplify and lower the cost of legacy application integration, data interchange, and publishing in a Web environment.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The Java WSDP 2.0 release offers next-generation web services through JAX-WS 2.0 EA, JAXB 2.0 EA, and SAAJ 1.3 EA technologies. Together these components support a new architecture, with more logical relationships between web services description, data binding, and SOAP attachment processing. The result is web services applications that are easier to develop, and more efficient and reliable to deploy. 
</p>
<p> 
Web Service development is further simplified with NetBeans 5.0, which uses the  
Java Web Services Developer Pack to develop web services clients. Users can develop next generation web services based on JAX-WS 2.0 & JAXB 2.0  
using the NetBeans 5.0 IDE, an open-source IDE project sponsored by Sun Microsystems, and the Java System Application Server, Platform Edition 8.2 from Sun Microsystems.
