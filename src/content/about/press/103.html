<p><b>NetBeans 3.5.1 Release: Japanese Edition & English Font Fix </b>

<b>PRAGUE, CZECH REPUBLIC -- July 31, 2003</b> -- The NetBeans.org open source project announces the immediate 
availability of the NetBeans IDE 3.5.1 and the first official NetBeans release in the Japanese language (<a href="http://netbeans.org/downloads/index.html">download here</a>).  Currently NetBeans IDE is available in English, Japanese, French, Russian and soon the first official Chinese Edition.  The localization's are all part of a continual effort by the NetBeans community to broaden it's user base on a global level.  Local language mailing list are also provided to ease communications and support between users.

<p>The 3.5.1 English language release contains bug fixes that improve the IDE's handling of text when the IDE's default font size is increased. These fixes were necessary to create a Chinese localization, since the Chinese characters require a larger font size to be readable. The Chinese localization should be available in a few weeks time.</p>

<p>If you are already using NetBeans IDE 3.5 and the font size issues do not affect you, it probably is not necessary for you to upgrade to v. 3.5.1. However, if you prefer to use a larger default font size in the IDE and you have problems with text not displaying properly, you may find this version to be an improvement.</p>

<p>Work on the 3.5 and 3.5.1 release was focused almost entirely on performance. Both startup time and general UI responsiveness have improved significantly.  In addition to that, several modules, previously available on the Update Center, have been added to the standard distribution. These modules provide many features, including support for:
<ul>
<li>debugging servlets and applications written with JSP technology.</li>
<li>creating and editing JSP tag libraries.</li>
<li>monitoring HTTP requests.</li>
<li>WAR file packaging.</li>
<li>connecting to and browsing databases.</li></ul>

<p>More information including system requirements, installation and upgrade instructions can be found in the README file:<br><ul><li>
