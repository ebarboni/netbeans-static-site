<p><b>New Features and Industry Leaders to Be Featured at CTIA Developer Event
</b></p>

<p><b> SANTA CLARA, Calif. April 4, 2006 Sun Microsystems, Inc. (Nasdaq: SUNW), maker of the award winning NetBeans Mobility Pack, today announced the availability of the NetBeans Mobility Pack 5.0 for Connected Device Configuration (CDC). The Mobility Pack for CDC was designed to bring the many advantages of the Java platform to a broad range of network-connected consumer and embedded devices, including smart communicators, high-end PDAs, and set-top boxes.
</b></p>

<p>The Mobility Pack for CDC ushers in the power of the NetBeans GUI Builder
(formerly Project Matisse) to the Java Platform, Micro Edition (Java ME)
authoring experience, bringing drag-and-drop screen design to a whole new
level of sophistication and ease. Other key features include support for
deployment to Symbian OS-based devices, application property editing, and
device emulator integration.
</p>

<p>Demonstrations of the new Mobility Pack for CDC, along with presentations
from industry leaders including Nokia, Sprint and UIQ are highlighted
agenda items for the NetBeans Mobility Day @ CTIA, a free developer event
being held April 5, 2006 at Harrah's Las Vegas.</p>

<p>Bringing world class tools support to the CDC configuration of the Java ME
platform is an important element of ensuring the growth and success of this
technology and the devices leveraging it.</p>

<p>"The NetBeans Mobility offering really simplifies the process of bringing
Java ME applications to market," said Alan Brenner, vice president, Client
Systems Group, Sun Microsystems. "This added support for CDC enables an
entire new class of mobile and embedded devices to benefit from its key,
productivity-enhancing features."</p>

<p>"The UIQ 3 SDK has been designed by UIQ Technology to be flexible enough to
support the SDK extensions from mobile phone manufacturers. Sony Ericsson
has delivered on this design with their CDC extension for the UIQ 3 SDK.
NetBeans support for CDC and the integration with the SDK further
strengthens UIQ as an application development platform," says Peter
Wikstrom, Head of Developer Program at UIQ Technology AB.</p>

<p>"The NetBeans Mobility Pack 5.0 for CDC enables NetBeans 5.0 to be used in
the context of CDC and its profiles" said Ulf Wretling, director and head
of Content Planning &amp; Management at Sony Ericsson. "With features such as
the NetBeans GUI builder, intelligent SIS file management and tight
integration with the Sony Ericsson CDC Platform 1 extension pack,
developers enjoy a complete development environment optimized for usage
with the new P990 smartphone and M600 messaging device based on Symbian OS
v9.1 and UIQ 3.0."</p>
