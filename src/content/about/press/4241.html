(Nasdaq: SUNW), the creator and leading advocate of Java technology, today announced it has expanded the current <a href="http://www.netbeans.org/community/partners/">NetBeans Partner Program</a> for companies that are building add-ons to NetBeans and recommending the IDE to their developer communities. The expanded NetBeans Strategic Partner Program offers new marketing benefits, technical support and incentives for its growing community.
</b></p>
<p>The expanded initiative provides incentives for members that have demonstrated full support of the NetBeans IDE and have met the business and technical requirements for invitation to the program. As members of the program, business partners will receive technical support, exclusive roadmap and planning briefings with the NetBeans team. In addition, partners are eligible for unique co-marketing opportunities with the Sun developer community including sponsorship and participation in NetBeans developer events, such as NetBeans Day, webinars for the community, and promotion on Sun and NetBeans web properties. Members of the NetBeans Strategic Partner Program will be identifiable by a special logo.

<p>"NetBeans has been a great partner for Sony Ericsson in enabling Java ME developers to bring compelling applications to market for our device portfolio," said Mikael Nerde, head of Sony Ericsson Developer and Accessory Programs & Content Planning Product and Application Planning. "Joining the Strategic Partner Program furthers our ability to deliver solutions for our current developers and expand our reach among the larger community."

"We believe that by joining the new Strategic Partner Program,we will be able to focus developments in our XTT Framework toward the needs of a wider range of developers much more effectively and we are pleased to be a part of this."

This underscores JBoss’ commitment to supporting all platforms, giving developers choice and a wide range of complementary solutions when using JBoss middleware," said Shaun Connolly, vice president of product management, JBoss, a division of Red Hat.
