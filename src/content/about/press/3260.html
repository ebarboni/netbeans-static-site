SavaJe Technologies Brings Benefits of Enterprise and Desktop Java Technology to Mobile Devices; Early Access Release for JSR-209 Opens World of Mobile Applications to Four Million Java Developers
</b></p>
<p>
Chelmsford, MA - May 11, 2006 - SavaJe Technologies, developers of the most advanced, Java™ technology-based mobile operating platform, today announced it will unveil the SavaJe-based Jasper S20 mobile phone during the 2006 JavaOne Conference&#8480;, hosted by Sun Microsystems (NASDAQ: SUNW) and slated for May 16-19 at the Moscone Center in San Francisco. The Jasper S20 is the first Java powered mobile phone to support an early access version of JSR-209 specifications, providing Java Platform Micro Edition application developers with the ability to create advanced user interfaces for mobile phones and devices using Swing and Java2D. This extends the potential population of mobile application developers to more than four million.
</p>
<p>
In related news, the SavaJe-based Jasper S20 has been named “Device of the Show” by JavaOne organizers, representing the importance of mobile Java to the entire Sun community. In a recent interview published by The New York Times, Jonathan Schwartz, CEO of Sun Microsystems said “More teenagers recognize Java than they do Microsoft, because that is what they have in their pocket on their cellphone.”
</p>
<p>
“SavaJe is not only demonstrating Java technology can be used for mobile phones, it is expanding its application developer community and has pushed application development into the mainstream by supporting JSR-209,” said Kevin Burden, Program Manager for Mobile Devices at IDC. “Java technology offers an inherently richer and more secure application environment, along with cross-platform deployment benefits. Today’s consumers want more personal and powerful communications, and now, a huge body of developers can bring applications to mobile phones as easily as the desktop. This is news that network operators and handset manufacturers can not afford to ignore.”
</p>
<p>
</p>
<p><b>
The SavaJe Mobile Platform&trade;</b><br/>

SavaJe brings the power of desktop Java to the mobile environment. This enables operators and handset manufacturers to rapidly brand and customize mobile handsets that deliver high performance and advanced features. The SavaJe Mobile Platform enables a truly differentiated and personalized user experience, while accelerating an operator’s ability to deliver unique services across multiple handsets.
</p>
<p>
SavaJe is the first mobile platform to demonstrate JSR-209. Developed under the Java Community Process, JSR-209 is a set of specifications that include Advanced Graphics and User Interface Optional Package, previously available only in the Java Standard and Enterprise Editions. This allows application developers to utilize Swing, Java2D Graphics and Imaging, and Image I/O. As a result, developers gain the functionality necessary to develop advanced applications for mobile phones and devices such as the Jasper S20 much more efficiently than they can under the constraints of MIDP. Vodafone Group Plc is leading the development and ratification of the JSR-209 specifications, which are currently in Final Draft.
</p>
<p>
<b>
Developer Benefits</b><br/>

Through the SavaJe Mobile Platform, developers benefit from a rich, highly functional Java environment which includes Connected Device Configuration (CDC), Foundation Profile, Personal Basis Profile and JSR-209. This makes it possible to write and easily test compelling applications in Java which traditionally had to be written in C or C++. Developers can write CDC Xlets to build mobile applications with rich user interfaces based on Swing components. The SavaJe platform also supports Mobile Information Device 2.0 (MIDP2.0) and JTWI (JSR-185) for full compatibility with existing J2ME applications.
</p>
<p>
Applications developed for the SavaJe Mobile Platform can inherit a “master” set of user experience parameters including look and feel because of Swing and SavaJe’s implementation of theme elements such as colors, fonts and icons. Xlets also use the advanced graphical user interface (UI) provided by JSR-209, allowing developers to create sophisticated UIs from a wide range of components with layout managers controlling placement. As a result, Xlets with Swing interfaces maintain the look and feel consistent with a device’s overall theme.
</p>
<p>
“A Java-based platform is the only way for operators and manufacturers to create mobile phones that deliver the richness consumers expect from their personal technology,” said Gregory Koss, CEO of SavaJe Technologies. “The SavaJe Mobile Platform alone brings advanced Java to mobile communications, offering the industry newfound revenue potential in customization and the selling of services, along with greater security and expedited product development. With a pool of millions of Java developers now able to apply their skills to mobile applications, it’s clear a new era in mobile communications is on the horizon.”
</p>
<p>
The SavaJe-based Jasper S20 is manufactured by Group Sense Limited of Hong Kong and will ship this summer in Asian markets. SavaJe will demonstrate and sell an advance version of the device during JavaOne at booth #1132. Experts will be available for development advice and the company will be offering related tools such as Sun’s NetBeans CDC SDK. The 2006 JavaOne Conference is the premier event for developers, providing Java enthusiasts with the opportunity to learn about the latest innovations, get hands-on experience with the technology and network with peers and industry experts.
