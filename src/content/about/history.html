        <h1>A Brief History of NetBeans</h1>

        <p>NetBeans started as a student project (originally called 
            <a href="http://xelfi.cz/">Xelfi</a>) in Czechoslovakia, now the Czech Republic, in 1996.  The goal was to write a Delphi-like
            Java IDE (Integrated Development
            Environment) in Java.  Xelfi was the first Java IDE written in Java, with its 
            first pre-releases in 1997. Xelfi was a fun project to work on, especially since the Java IDE
            space was uncharted territory at that time.</p>
        
        <p>Here you see the original group of students who constituted the original NetBeans Team:</p>
        
        <p><img alt="original NetBeans Team" src="../images_www/articles/nb-history-1.png"/></p>
            
        <p>The project attracted
            enough interest that the students, once they graduated, decided
            that they could market it as a commercial product. Soliciting resources
            from friends and relatives for a website, they formed a company
            around it.<br>
        </p><p>Soon after, they were contacted by Roman Stanek,
            an
            entrepreneur who had already been involved in several startups. He was looking for a good idea to invest in, and
            discovered Xelfi. He met with the founders; they hit it off, and a
            business
            was born. The original business plan was to develop network-enabled JavaBeans components.
            Jaroslav Tulach, who designed the IDE's basic architecture, came up with the name
            <i>Net</i>Beans to describe what the components would do.  The IDE would be the way to deliver
            them. When the specification for 
            Enterprise Java Beans came out, it made more sense to work with the standard for
            such components than to compete with it--but the name stuck.
        </p>
        <p>In the spring of 1999, <a href="http://www.internetnews.com/dev-news/article.php/75561">
                NetBeans DeveloperX2</a> was released, supporting Swing.  The performance 
            improvements that came in JDK 1.3, released in the fall of 1999, made NetBeans
            a viable choice for development tools.  By the summer of 1999, the team
            was hard at work re-architecting DeveloperX2 into the more modular NetBeans that
            forms the basis of the software today.</p>

        <h2>More Than An IDE... and Open Sourced</h2>

        <p>Along the way, an interesting thing happened.
            People began building applications using the NetBeans IDE's platform, together with
            their own plugins, often <a href="https://netbeans.org/features/platform/showcase.html">creating applications that were not development tools at all</a>.
            In fact, this turned out to have
            quite a market. Later, in 2000 and 2001, a lot of work
            went into stripping out pieces that made the assumption that an
            application
            built on NetBeans was an IDE, so that the platform would be a
            generic desktop application suitable to any purpose. This work turned
            out to
            be healthy for the codebase of the IDE as well, encouraging a clean API
            design and a separation of
            concerns.
        </p>
        <p>
            Something else was afoot in the summer of 1999. 
            Sun Microsystems wanted better
            Java development tools, and had become interested in NetBeans.  It was a dream
            come true for the NetBeans team. NetBeans would become the flagship tool set of the maker of Java
            itself! By the Fall, with the next generation of NetBeans Developer
            in beta, a deal was struck. Sun Microsystems had also acquired another tools company, Fort&eacute;, at the same time, and
            decided to rename NetBeans to <span style="font-style: italic;">Fort&eacute; for Java</span>. The name <span style="font-style: italic;">NetBeans</span> was dropped--for a while.
        </p><p>During the acqusition, the young developers who had been
            involved in open-source projects for most of their programming careers,
            mentioned the idea of open-sourcing NetBeans. Fast forward to less than
            six months later, the decision was made that NetBeans would be
            open sourced. While Sun had contributed considerable amounts of code to
            open source projects over the
            years, this was Sun's first <i>sponsored</i> open source project, one in which Sun
            would be paying for the site and handling the infrastructure. The very
            first decision made was that it sounded logical to call the new site: NetBeans.org. In June 2000, 
            <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20000815061212/https://netbeans.org/index.html">the initial netbeans.org web site</a> 
            was launched. The years that followed focused on continual enhancements from
            release to release, as described in the section below.</p>
        <p>When Oracle acquired Sun in 2010, NetBeans became part of Oracle, which continues to
            sponsor it. Oracle actively seeks new developers to work on the NetBeans team
            and sees NetBeans IDE as the official IDE for the Java Platform.<br>


        <h2>Continual Enhancements from Release to Release</h2>
        <p>An open source project is a living entity that needs time to find
            the right balance of people and contribution. Its growth is always an
            ongoing process.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The first year (through NetBeans 3.2), the project
                spent trying to find its feet. The next few years involved learning about what worked in terms of
                open-source processes. (In the first two years, the development process
                was so open that more time was spent debating than implementing.) 
                The growing pains paid off. With NetBeans 3.5, huge strides in
                performance were made,
                and tests and processes put in place to prevent regressions. With 3.6,
                the windowing system and property sheet were reimplemented, and the
                user interface cleaned up tremendously.</li>
            <li>NetBeans 4 was a complete change in the way the IDE worked. A new
                project system not only revamped the user experience, but also made
                it possible to replace infrastructure that had held the
                NetBeans back. The NetBeans 4.1 release was built on the new project
                infrastructure of 4.0,
                and added more features and full J2EE support.</li>
            <li>NetBeans 5 introduced comprehensive support for developing IDE
                modules and rich client applications based on the NetBeans platform; an
                intuitive GUI builder (Matisse); new and redesigned CVS support;
                support for Sun ApplicationServer 8.2, Weblogic 9 and JBoss 4. </li>
            <li>NetBeans 6 focused on improved developer productivity through
                a rewritten, smarter and faster editor, together with the
                integration of external NetBeans products into one IDE.
            </li>
            <li>NetBeans 7 was released together with JDK 7, providing editor tools
                for working with new JDK 7 language constructs, together with
                support for JavaFX 2.0, in 7.1, a range of performance enhancements
                throughout the IDE in 7.2, and support for HTML5 applications
                in 7.3.
            </li>

        </ul>


        <p>Subsequent releases continued to build on the success of previous releases and the demands of a changing industry. Press accolades, industry awards and favorable developer reviews followed.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
            Today, the NetBeans team couldn't be prouder of how far the NetBeans project and community has come. 
            It is also worth noting that  
            many of the original architects are still involved in the
            project, and can
            be found participating on the NetBeans mailing lists. There are more
            people using NetBeans software than ever before, in 2010 the 1,000,000 active
            user mark was reached. NetBeans IDE continues to
            improve, while the community grows at a fast clip.
