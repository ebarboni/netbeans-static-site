<h1>NetBeans Usage Data Tracking</h1>
<p>The goal of usage data tracking is to collect and analyze statistical information about
high-level features NetBeans users use. A better understanding which are
the most and least frequently used features helps us better plan and design future releases.
The collected data is strictly anonymous and it is sent to the
netbeans.org server automatically. The data collection and submission have no 
performance impact and do not affect regular work flow.
</p>
<h3>What kind of usage data is being collected</h3>
<p>
<ul>
<li>IDE configuration - build number, OS info, list of enabled plug-ins</li>
<li>Use of project types (e.g. Java SE, Java SE Freeform, Java Web Application, Java Enterprise Application, Ruby / Rails Application, PHP, C/C++, NB Module project, etc.)</li>
<li>Use of web application frameworks (e.g. Struts, JSF, Visual JSF, Spring, Hibernate, etc.)</li>
<li>Types and versions of servers and runtimes used for deployment (e.g. GlassFish, Tomcat, WebSphere, JBoss, WebLogic, WEBrick, etc.)</li>
<li>Types of JDBC drivers used for connections to databases (e.g. MySQL, JavaDB, Oracle, etc.)</li>
<li>Use of specific productivity features (e.g. Debugger, Profiler, GUI Builder)</li>
<li>Types of version control systems used by users (CVS, Subversion, Mercurial, ClearCase, etc.)</li>
<li>Accesses to Help topics.</li>
</ul>
<h3>What data is NOT being collected</h3>
