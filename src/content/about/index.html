    <h1>Welcome to the NetBeans Community</h1>
    <p>Most developers recognize the NetBeans IDE as the original free
      Java IDE.
      It is that, and much more! The NetBeans IDE provides support
      for several languages (PHP, JavaFX, C/C++, JavaScript, etc.) and
      frameworks. <br>
    </p>
    <p>NetBeans is an open-source project dedicated to providing rock
      solid software development products (the <a
        href="https://netbeans.org/features/ide/index.html">NetBeans IDE</a>&nbsp;and
      the&nbsp;<a
        href="https://netbeans.org/features/platform/index.html">NetBeans

        Platform</a>) that address the&nbsp;needs of developers, users
      and the businesses who rely on NetBeans as a basis for their
      products; particularly, to enable them to develop these products
      quickly, efficiently and easily by leveraging the strengths of the
      Java platform and other relevant industry standards.<br>

    <p>In June 2000, NetBeans was made <a href="os/index.html">open
        source</a> by
      Sun Microsystems, which remained the project sponsor until January
      2010 when Sun Microsystems became a subsidiary of Oracle.
