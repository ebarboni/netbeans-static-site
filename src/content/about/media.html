<h1>NetBeans Multilingual (ML) DVD Starter Kit Program</h1>


<p>
</p>Thank you for your interest in the NetBeans Multilingual DVD Starter Kit. Since
August 2005, NetBeans.org has shipped more than 225,000 free CDs
&amp; DVDs to developers around the world through the Starter
Kit Program. <br>


<p>Over this time, NetBeans has experienced explosive
growth as a community, and so has demand for our software.</p>


<p>We no longer offer free shipping of the NetBeans DVD Starter Kit,
but we provide several ways for the community to still receive our
award-winning tool:</p>
<ul>
  <li><p>Visit the <a href="https://netbeans.org/downloads/index.html">NetBeans IDE download page</a> for free installation bundles as lightweight as 23MB. You can always <a href="http://wiki.netbeans.org/FaqDownloadingUCModule">add more features</a> to the IDE later.</p></li>
  <li><p>Download and burn a free <a href="http://edu.netbeans.org/dvd/">ISO image</a> of the NetBeans IDE Multilingual (ML) DVD Starter Kit.</p></li>
  <li><p>Download the NetBeans IDE + JDK bundle using Oracle's <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/downloads/">JavaSE Download Manager</a> which allows you to pause, resume, restart, and verify downloaded files. </p></li>
</ul>

<p> 
Thank you again for your continued support, and for your interest in the NetBeans project!
