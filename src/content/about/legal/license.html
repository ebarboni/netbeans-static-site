<h1>The Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL) and GNU
Public License v.2 w/Classpath Exception</h1>
<p>
The majority of the NetBeans IDE code is available under a
<a href="https://netbeans.org/cddl-gplv2.html">dual license
consisting of the Common Development and Distribution License (CDDL)
v1.0
and the GNU General Public License (GPL) v2</a>.
NetBeans distributions include
additional components under separate licenses identified in the
<a href="./product-licences.html">License file</a>. See the
<a href="./product-licences.html">Third Party License file</a> for external
components included in NetBeans and their associated licenses.
</p>
<p>
Versions of NetBeans sources prior to the 5.5 release were made
available under the terms of the Sun Public License. A discussion of
the reasons for this change can be found
<a href="license-change.html">here</a>.
</p>
<p>Both the CDDL and the earlier SPL are based on the Mozilla Public
License (MPL); CDDL is a more reusable license, and was
written to be more readable. Both have the same attributes: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Sources licensed under them may be reused in commercial products</li>
  <li>Changes made directly in the sources - bug fixes or enhancements
- must be
contributed back to the netbeans.org, but new source files which you
write that link to NetBeans code do not need to be</li>
</ul>
<h2>License Notices in Source Files</h2>
Source files on netbeans.org do not need to have the full text
of the license in them; instead, just a header mentioning that they are
covered under this license is required. The header should read
(ignoring any necessary comment characters):
