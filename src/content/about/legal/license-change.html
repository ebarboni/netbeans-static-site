<h1>Dual Licensing NetBeans IDE 6.0 under the CDDL and GPLv2 with Claspath Exception</h1>

<p>
Since launching NetBeans.org in 2000, the source code license for NetBeans has evolved from the open source
<a href="license-spl.html">Sun Public License</a> to the open-source <a href="/cddl.html">Common Development and Distribution License</a>. With the release of NetBeans IDE 6.0 beta, we add the GNU Public License v.2 to the CDDL already in place.   The majority of the NetBeans IDE 6.0 code is available under a <a href="/cddl-gplv2.html">dual license consisting of the Common Development and Distribution License ( CDDL) v1.0 and the GNU General Public License (GPL) v2</a>.
</p>

<h2>Why change licenses?</h2>
<ul>
<li>The GPL v2.0 license will provide an additional option to vendors that are unable to work with  NetBeans under the CDDL license.</li>
<li>Adding GPLv2 as a license option will make NetBeans even more Linux friendly.</li>
<li>Adding GPLv2 with Classpath exception to NetBeans will keep product portfolios and bundles  consistent.  Sun open  sourced its JDK implementation under GPLv2  and  the GlassFish project  is dual-licensed under CDDL and GPLv2 with Classpath exception.</li>
</ul>
<p>
Both the CDDL and the GPLv2 are <a href="http://www.opensource.org/">OSI</a>-approved licenses that meet the requirements of the <a href="http://www.opensource.org/docs/definition.php">Open Source Definition</a>.
</p>

<h2>Impact for Developers</h2>
<p>
We expect this change to have no significant impact on either projects using NetBeans software or developers writing software that integrates with NetBeans. The license notices required in source files will change - this is the only thing likely to affect developers' daily work.

<h2>Dual License Mini FAQ:</h2>
<p><b>Q: What is the licensing change?</b><br>
A: Sun introduces GPLv2 with Classpath exception for
           NetBeans as a second license  option along with CDDL.  GPL
           v2 is an open-source license.  Please see <a href="http://opensource.org/licenses/gpl-license.php">the text of the license</a>.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q: Why does Sun want to dual license NetBeans under CDDL and GPLv2?</b><br>
A: <ul><li>The GPL v2.0 license will provide an additional option to
           vendors that are unable to work with  NetBeans under the
           CDDL license.</li>
	     <li>Adding GPLv2 as a license option will make NetBeans even
           more Linux friendly.</li>
	     <li>Adding GPLv2 with Classpath exception to NetBeans will keep
           product portfolios and bundles  consistent.  Sun open
           sourced its JDK implementation under GPLv2  and  the
           GlassFish project  is dual-licensed under CDDL and GPLv2
           with Classpath exception.</li></ul>
</p>
<p>
<b>Q: What is the Classpath exception?</b><br>
A: The Classpath exception was developed by the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/classpath/license.html">Free Software
           Foundation's GNU/Classpath  Project</a>. It
           allows you to link an  application available under any
           license to a library that is part of software licensed under
           GPL  v2, without that application being subject to the GPL's
           requirement to be itself offered to the  public under the GPL. 
</p>
<p>
<b> Q: Why is the Classpath exception necessary?</b><br>
A: If an application needs to be distributed with parts of
           NetBeans under GPL v2, that application  could be subject to
           the requirements of the GPL that all code that is shipped as
           part of a "work  based on the [GPL] program" also be GPL
           licensed. Accordingly, a GPL license exception is  needed
           that specifically excludes from this licensing requirement
           any application that links to the  GPL implementation. The
           Classpath exception accomplishes this.  This would be, for
           example,  important for module developers, that are always
           linking with NetBeans APIs, but also for those  that build
           applications on top of the NetBeans Platform.
</p>
<p>
<b>Q: How will adding GPL v2 affect current distributions?</b><br>
A: It will not affect current distributions. Current and future
           distributions will still be available under  CDDL. New
           distributions starting with NetBeans 6.0 will be available
           under both CDDL and  GPLv2 with Classpath exception. 
</p>
<p>
<b>Q: How can something be released under two licenses?</b><br>
A: Dual-licensing is the practice of distributing identical
           software under two (or more) different sets  of terms and
           conditions.  When software is dual-licensed, recipients can
           choose which terms  under which they want to obtain the
           software. The two usual motivations for dual-licensing are
           business models and licence compatibility.  In the case of
           NetBeans, we're distributing the code under two licenses,
           CDDL and GPLv2 with  Classpath Exception, for license
           compatibility. That will allow code from differently
           licensed free  software projects to be combined with
           NetBeans, and will give our users the choice to pick a
           license that they feel more comfortable with. Sun is adding
           GPLv2 as the option, since as a  matter of policy, Sun never
           takes rights away, so the NetBeans code will continue to be
           available  under the CDDL license.
