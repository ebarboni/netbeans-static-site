      <h4>I already have NetBeans IDE, how do I get the quiz plugin?</h4>
      <p>You install the quiz plugin directly from the NetBeans IDE. Go to <b>Tools -> Plugins</b> and

      <h4>I'm having trouble connecting to the NetBeans Update Center. Can you help?</h4>
      <p>Check your proxy settings. Go to <b>Tools -> Options -> General</b>. Specify the general proxy settings the IDE uses to access the Internet by choosing one of the following:
      No Proxy, Use System Proxy Settings, or Manual Proxy Settings. To use Manual Proxy settings, 
      you must specify the HTTP Proxy and Proxy Port. The HTTP Proxy is the host name or numeric IP address of the proxy server to use to connect to HTTP and FTP sites. The Proxy Port is the port number of the proxy server. 
      Click <b>More</b> to configure more advanced proxy settings.</p>

int winnerIdx = new Random().nextInt(correct.size());</pre>
