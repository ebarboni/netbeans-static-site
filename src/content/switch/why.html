<h1>Top Reasons to Switch to the NetBeans IDE<br>
</h1>
<br>
The NetBeans integrated development environment (IDE) delivers. The
NetBeans IDE can boost your productivity when you're working with Java
SE, Java EE, or Java ME technology as well as PHP, Groovy, JavaScript,
and C/C++. Visual tools that generate skeleton code are also available,
letting you create a basic application without writing a single line of
code.<br>
<br>
Here are top reasons to use the NetBeans IDE:<br>
<ol>
  <li><strong>Works Out of the Box</strong>
    <p>Simply <a href="https://netbeans.org/downloads/index.html">download</a>
and install the NetBeans IDE and you are good to go. Installation is a
breeze with its small download size. All IDE tools and features are
fully integrated—no need to hunt for plug-ins—and they work together
when you launch the IDE.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Free and Open Source</strong>
    <p> When you use the NetBeans IDE, you join a vibrant, <a
 href="https://netbeans.org/community/index.html">open-source
community</a> of thousands of users ready to help and contribute. There
are discussions on the <a
 href="https://netbeans.org/community/lists/" target="_blank">NetBeans
mailing
lists</a>, blogs on <a href="http://www.planetnetbeans.org/">PlanetNetBeans</a>,

and
helpful
    <a href="http://wiki.netbeans.org/wiki/view/NetBeansUserFAQ"
 target="_blank">FAQs</a>. </p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Connected Developer</strong>
    <p> The NetBeans IDE is the tool of choice for teams working in a <a
 href="https://netbeans.org/kb/trails/tools.html">collaborative
environment</a>. You can create and manage java.net-hosted projects,
for example; file issue tracking reports using both Jira and Bugzilla,
and collaborate with like-minded developers—all directly from within
the familiar interface of the IDE. </p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Powerful GUI Builder</strong>
    <p>The GUI Builder (formerly known as Project Matisse) supports a
sophisticated yet simplified <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/developer/technicalArticles/javase/swingappfr/">Swing
Application
Framework</a> and <a
 href="https://netbeans.org/kb/docs/java/gui-binding.html">Beans
Binding</a>. <span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">Now you can <a
 href="https://netbeans.org/files/documents/4/475/matisse.html"
 target="_blank">build GUIs</a> in a natural way.</span></p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Support for Java Standards and Platforms </strong>
    <p>The IDE provides end-to-end solutions for all Java development
platforms including the latest Java standards. </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Java Mobility Support</strong> Complete environment
to create, test, and run applications for mobile devices. With
preprocessor blocks, you can readily handle fragmentation issues.
Support for Java Mobility development is the best among all Java
development tools.</li>
      <li><strong>Java Enterprise Edition (EE) 6 support</strong>: The
first free, open-source IDE to support Java EE 6 specifications.</li>
      <li><strong>Java Standard Edition (SE) Support</strong>: You can
develop applications using the latest Java SE standards. </li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Profiling and Debugging Tools</strong>
    <p>With NetBeans IDE <a href="../features/java/profiler.html"
 target="_blank">profiler</a>, you get realtime insight into memory
usage and potential performance bottlenecks. Furthermore, you can
instrument specific parts of code to avoid performance degradation
during profiling. The <a
 href="http://profiler.netbeans.org/docs/help/6.0/heapwalker.html"
 target="_blank">HeapWalker</a> tool helps you evaluate Java heap
contents and find memory leaks.<br>
    </p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Dynamic Language Support</strong>
    <p> The <span style="margin-bottom: 0in;">NetBeans IDE provides
integrated support for scripting languages such as <a
 href="https://netbeans.org/features/php/index.html">PHP</a>, <a
 href="https://netbeans.org/features/groovy/index.html">Groovy</a>,
and <a href="https://netbeans.org/features/javascript/index.html">JavaScript</a>.</span></p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>PHP</strong>: With the NetBeans IDE for PHP, you get
the best of both worlds: the productivity of an IDE (code completion,
real-time error checking, debugging and more) with the speed and
simplicity of your favorite text editor in a less than 30mb download.</li>
      <li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: The NetBeans IDE has the
JavaScript tools you need: an intelligent JavaScript editor, CSS/HTML
code completion, the ability to debug JavaScript in Firefox and IE, and
bundled popular JavaScript libraries. Your favorite JavaScript
framework will get you 80% of the way, NetBeans IDE will help you with
that last 20%<span style="text-decoration: underline;"></span>.</li>
      <li><strong>Groovy</strong>: In the NetBeans IDE, you can now
create Grails applications, integrate Groovy scripts with your JavaSE
project.</li>
<!--<li><strong>JavaFX</strong>: The NetBeans IDE is the official
tool for JavaFX development! See your visual code live in the editor,
and analyze your application's performance with the JavaFX Profiler. <br>
      </li>-->
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Extensible Platform</strong>
    <p> Start with its <a href="http://platform.netbeans.org"
 target="_blank">extensible platform</a> and add your own NetBeans IDE
features and extensions or build an IDE-like application, keeping only
features you want. Extending the platform and its Swing-based
foundation saves development time and can optimize performance. </p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Customizable Projects</strong>
    <p>Through the NetBeans IDE build process, which relies on industry
standards such as <a href="http://ant.apache.org/" target="_blank">Apache
Ant</a>, <a href="http://www.gnu.org/software/make/">make</a>, <a
 href="http://maven.apache.org/">Maven</a>, and <a
 href="http://rake.rubyforge.org/">rake</a>, rather than a proprietary
build process, you can easily customize projects and add functionality.
You can build, run, and deploy projects to servers outside of the IDE. </p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Non-Java Code Support</strong>
    <p> You're not limited to the Java programming language. You can
include many other programming languages, such as <a
 href="https://netbeans.org/features/cpp/index.html">C/C++</a>,
scripting languages like JavaScript, etc. Even more exciting, <a
 href="http://wiki.netbeans.org/wiki/view/Schliemann">define your own
language</a> and include it in your projects.</p>
  </li>
  <li><strong>Dedicated Support Available</strong>
    <p> When you can't get the help you need from the community,
consider <a href="../kb/support.html">Developer Support Packages</a>,
which offer programming advice, software support, and <a
 href="../kb/training.html">training</a> credits. </p>
  </li>
