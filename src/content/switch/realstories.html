<h1>Real Stories from People Switching to the NetBeans IDE!</h1>














<p>Many developers are migrating their applications to the NetBeans IDE from
other IDEs. <br>
Here are some of their stories. <br>

<h2>Kalvin Osborne, Lead developer for <a href="http://xipolec.tk/">XIPOLEC</a>, Northern British Columbia, Canada</h2>



<blockquote>I have used almost all, if not all, the IDEs that have
looked good enough to try. My top two: Notepad++ and NetBeans. I would
never use NotePad++ for C/C++/Java, and that's why I use NetBeans.
I used to use Code::Blocks, it's a great IDE, don't get me wrong, but
pretty soon, a certain error and how it acts just hit the wrong nerve.
VC++... well, I don't like Microsoft Products to begin with, so this
was a natural disaster waiting to happen, and guess what... it
happened...
<br>
  <br>
So I went online to search for Java, the language I've been refusing
for so long. I knew about NetBeans and Eclipse, and knew that both of
them were pretty good with Java. Eclipse was nice, but NetBeans has a
much more comfortable feel to it. I opened NetBeans, and
found some cool stuff, which I later learned that Eclipse doesn't have!
So, I'm very happy with NetBeans and I'll be using it, at least for
Java. </blockquote>




<h2>Pete, KP Direction</h2>





<blockquote>
I've been developing websites since 1999, and at kpdirection since 2001, starting
with Macromedia Dreamweaver Ultradev. I stayed with the DW tools until version 8, when I
got fed up with the continual costs of upgrading and the traditional bugs on release 1 of
any version. 
<br><br>
Looking for an alternative, I came across Aptana, and it blew me away. A PHP IDE with
debugging built in (DW didn't have that a the time), and great facilities. I dropped DW
and was a loyal Aptana user for over a year. Until they dropped all PHP support from the tool, 
changed the FTP method (and broke
it), and generally showed that they no longer had a strategy to support PHP developers.

<br><br> I looked around for alternatives. The search took a few weeks,
and I tried all the PHP IDE's out there. NetBeans came out
the winner - not least because it wasn't based on a bloated Eclipse
platform, and being
free, I couldn't argue with the price. I've been using NetBeans since
6.8 was released, and I'm completely happy that this is the
right choice for our development needs in the future. Well done to all
the people involved
in producing such a great IDE.

<h2>Werner Vesteraas, Norway</h2>





<blockquote>
I got fed up with Eclipse after four years.  It has become a sluggish beast.  NetBeans is
now my weapon of choice.
  </blockquote>














  
<h2>Doug Puchalski</h2>






<blockquote>







Free software is great. But it feels odd that I don't have to pay for this one!
<br><br>
I've tried Eclipse, Zend Studio, Komodo, RubyMine... and almost didn't
bother with NetBeans because it seemed that any IDE was bound to be a
disappointment. I was surprised by the responsiveness without
sacrificing high-level functionality, and the feature set that seems to
anticipate exactly what I want and would have designed into the
product. And I keep discovering new amazing things every week.
<br><br>I can't say enough good things about NetBeans. Rarely do I use
software that seems to anticipate my needs before I even realize them
myself.

<blockquote>Excerpt from blog entry: <a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://daniel-noz.blogspot.com/2009/07/netbeans-ide-67-refcard.html">NetBeans IDE 6.7 Refcard</a><br>
<br>
I switched from Eclipse to Netbeans about 2 years ago and I am
completely happy with it.
What I like most is that this IDE gets better and better with every
release, even with release candidates or master releases. I think the
main difference between Eclipse and Netbeans is, that Netbeans focuses
on providing the very basic functionality for a developer. It is very
well tested and has a great integration with databases and application
servers.

<h2>Adam McMahon</h2>















<blockquote>

No crazy configuration necessary. It works right away!<br>
<br>

I have been using Eclipse for several years for Servlet development. I decided to give
NetBeans 6 a try, and I was amazed at the integration of the development environment. In
my experience, it takes much time to configure Eclipse to properly develop web components.
Yet, right out of the box, NetBeans is pre-configured to develop, debug, and deploy web
components quickly onto Tomcat (which is included with the download). While I am still
surveying the features, I am impressed how quickly I could deploy a new web application.

<h2>Josh Eckerman, Eventux, LLC</h2>











<blockquote>I just wanted to say that NetBeans 6.7.1 has blown myself
and my team away. Eclipse and Aptana Studio Pro were our standbys.
After using this, we've begun a migration to NetBeans, and everyone is
hitting the ground running.
I shouldn't really call it a "migration" either. Just import, and off
you go. Excellent work, and praise for all involved. </blockquote>










<h2>Jamie P</h2>










<blockquote>
I switched to NetBeans about 6 months ago, after using just about every IDE out there for
the past 9 years. Never going back...

  <br>
NetBeans is an IDE that stands out above all others. It's completely free. It offers a
built-in FTP client (Far superior to Dreamweaver) or supports subversion publishing. It is
very small, fast, and has many built-in features that help create better code, more
efficiently. Netbeans is hands down the best IDE, with the least about of bugs, and
virtually no learning curve (Try that Eclipse...), that I've used.

  <br>
  <br>
If you are holding on to Dreamweaver because of the FTP, or some other function that
Eclipse PDE or Zend Studio is lacking, I urge you to take a look at Netbeans. When I'm not
using SVN, I can save the file I'm working on, and it is automatically uploaded to the web
or testing server. Try it, you won't be disappointed.</blockquote>






<h2>Alan Stanley</h2>















<blockquote>

I love NetBeans.  I work in a development and support shop.  
I've managed to convert a number of die-hard Eclipse guys over to NetBeans.<br>
  <br>

NetBeans unpacks and sets up easily.  The
user interface is intuitive, and the drag and drop palettes are easy
and transparent.  The automatic integration of Frameworks (along with
the tutorials) makes acquiring facility with new Java technologies
relatively easy.  I now implement MVC easily without having to
memorize arcane directory structures.  The built-in example apps are
self-explanatory and highly instructive.<br>
  <br>

It's a good product, and attractively priced.  I've written and
deployed web based support apps from some of my clients in as little
as an hour or two.

<blockquote>

So, I’m now self employed. That means I need software, and I need it to be either free or inexpensive. [...]
This took a while of jumping from site to site, checking out feature  
comparison charts, trying different software, and so on. I wanted  
something free, and feature packed. My main requirements were great  
handling of PHP code, and great Javascript - jQuery in particular.<br>
  <br>

Ultimately it came down to a showdown between Aptana Studio and  
NetBeans, and while they were pretty close, Aptana’s PHP plug-in  
failed me miserably when it came to actual usage: When I launched the  
site (via “Run” function, if I remember correctly), my entire site  
was squished onto one line. That means that opening <tt>//&lt;![CDATA 
[</tt> comments would comment out entire scripts. Needless to say, that  
soured Aptana’s viability completely, and after looking into a fix  
for about an hour, I declared NetBeans the winner. I’d say that it’s  
a permanent replacement for Dreamweaver in my book; NetBeans is  
pretty much a PHP coder’s dream come true.

<blockquote>








My company bought three 3-year licenses for Zend Studio earlier this
and up until a few weeks ago, there was nothing else on the market that
even came close to meeting our requirements. Then NetBeans released 6.5
with PHP support. Right out of the gate, their PHP and JavaScript
support is on the whole, so much better and faster than Zend's product,
with so many fewer bugs, that despite the fact that we spent $1000 this
year investing in Zend's product, and I personally have spent time with
Zend's tech support and developers (good guys, very helpful), I am
assisting my team in migrating over to use NetBeans for most of our
development....

Excerpt from blog: <a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2008/12/16/php-support-in-netbeans-65/">PHP support in NetBeans 6.5</a></div>



















<blockquote>

        Long dismissed as a “toy Java IDE”, NetBeans—Sun’s open source
        Integrated Development Evironment (IDE)—has really grown up in
        recent years. No longer is it just for Java, either: for web
        developers, NetBeans 6.5 now supports Ruby and PHP out of the
        box. Surprisingly, that support is so good that it now compares
        favourably to more established competitors like Eclipse, Komodo
        IDE, and Zend Studio.<br>
&nbsp;<br>
        
        I had become used to writing my PHP code in a simple text editor
        (jEdit, if you’re wondering), so it had been awhile since I’d
        enjoyed the luxuries of project-wide code completion, code
        refactoring, and a full debugger. All of these and more are
        available in NetBeans 6.5. [...]
  <br>
        
        <br>
Of course, writing PHP applications is more than just PHP code.
        You have to write HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code as well. When
        you do, you’ll be pleasantly surprised to find the same level of
        support for these languages built into NetBeans too! And when a
        single file mixes these languages together, NetBeans handles it
        all seamlessly.
  <br>

        <br>
NetBeans isn’t a toy for learning Java anymore. These days, it’s
        a powerful, multi-language development environment that’s free
        for the taking. If you work on sizable PHP projects and you’re
        not using an IDE like NetBeans, you might be surprised at how
        much time a tool like this can save you!

<blockquote>
...There are few features I expect my IDE to have. Code completion is
one of them, and in NetBEans it looks awesome. ...
I’m officially in love with NetBeans for now. I’ve been using NuSphere
PhpEd for some time, it also has similar feature but does not write the
require statement like NetBeans. It’s the small things that make people
happy. Another thing, and the most important one, NetBeans is free.
There are few other things in which NetBeans stands out of the crowd,
like XHTML code completion and so on. This post is not intended to be
some detailed review of a product. It’s a merely an personal
observation. I’m just saying I feel more comfortable now, today, using
NetBeans than using Zend or NuSpere; not to mention the cost of each of
them. If you have some spare time, give it a try.

To NB team:<br>
  <br>
... I personally think you have the best IDE out there already for PHP
development. You won't have any trouble at all getting people to
convert from other IDEs to NetBeans, that I am certain of...
The more users you can reach at these early stages will help with user
feedback and to drive future feature development.
I have already switched the whole company to NetBeans for PHP, but
little ol' me isn't enough to reach the masses. :) I think your efforts
and product so far are so good you should get people running down the
streets wearing T-Shirts and singing. :) </blockquote>

<blockquote>
... The fact that NetBeans offers a full-fledged IDE
that runs on multiple platforms is enough in itself. The fact that it
has support for every language you could ever want (or need) to write
code in is nearly unprecedented. The fact that it does all of this
better than any IDE
I've ever seen is teetering on goofy. The fact that it's open source is
down right nuts. ...<br>
  <br>
The IDE war will never be settled. Maybe that's for the best, to each
his own.
However, the bottom line is NetBeans
makes you a better developer. It helps you do your job, and it helps
you do your job well. The fact that it covers the major elements of all
of the languages it supports is second to none. Break your code down by
classes? Done. Attach an in-depth profiler? Cake. Debugger? You
betcha'.
Source control? Look ma', no hands. ...<br>
  <br>
If you've never tried NetBeans, I strongly encourage you to do
so. It's alright, you don't have to tell anyone that you're using
NetBeans.
You can lock yourself away, keep all the lights off, cover your face if
you must, but just try it. Once you put all the hype aside, you'll
realize just how invaluable a tool like NetBeans is.
And then you'll wonder why you weren't using it years ago.<br>

Excerpt from blog entry: <a style="font-style: italic;" href="http://sun-java.cs.ukzn.ac.za/%7Erobd/myblog/netbeans.html">Java
and NetBeans - Finally a Brew that I am Able to Enjoy</a><br>

  <br>
  As an academic teaching Computer Science for the past thirty years
(currently <a href="http://www.cs.ukzn.ac.za/">here</a>) I have seen
major changes take place in terms of the programmers working
environment. ... However because of my university's commitment to MS, I
have also used Borland's programming IDE with Pascal, C, C++ and Java.
But because of my commitment to free software, I have always been on
the lookout for an IDE that I could share with my students with them
working under MS and me under Linux.<br>
  <br>
When NetBeans first appeared, I tried it, but only once as it was
so slow on my box that it was unusable. This has however changed in
recent times and I have tried it again, only to abandon it as it was
often an overkill for small teaching level programming projects. I also
tried Eclipse and abandoned it for the same reason. These more recent
efforts were renewed efforts to migrate from Emacs to bring myself into
line with my colleagues and students who as I have already mentioned
mostly used Borland's IDE. I should also admit that I also wanted to
access the additional capabilities these IDEs now offered.<br>
  <br>
This year I have once again tried both NetBeans and Eclipse. This
time NetBeans 6.0 won me over. It worked out of the box both under
Windows XP and openSUSE 10.3. It is also fast thanks to advances in
hardware and so far has allowed me to easily develop non-GUI Java
applications (programming assignments) for the Object Oriented
Programming module that I am currently teaching. My students who used
Borland's JBuilder previously, were equally impressed.
  <br>
For me, NetBeans now works and I have encouraged my colleagues to
consider using it for their teaching!

Eclipse Veteran Switches To NetBeans</a></i><br>
  <br>
...I had briefly tried NetBeans before, however I always went back to
Eclipse because it offered a much better Java editor, I think this has
changed in version 6 of NetBeans. Things I earlier missed from the
Eclipse editor are now available in NetBeans, such as:<br>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>highlighting a variable highlights it everywhere in the file,
making it
easy to see where it is been used.<br>
    </li>
    <li>crtl+clicking a method call navigates to the method declaration<br>
    </li>
    <li>Any file can be quickly opened via a keyboard shortcut (in
Eclipse it is
ctrl+shift+R, in NetBeans it is shift+alt+O)<br>
    </li>
    <li>ctrl+space automatically suggests variable names</li>
  </ul>
  
...All in all, with the improvements made to the NetBeans editor, the
tight
integration with Maven, and the painless way of setting up a JSF
project (essentially, all required code completion and features works
"automagically")
NetBeans has now surpassed Eclipse in usability. Count me in as a new
convert.

give NetBeans a try
and, Thank God, I don’t have any issues yet… I’ve done my 300th

redeployments seem to go pretty smoothly and take a couple seconds to

<h2>Maciej Wegorkiewicz, Software Consultant</h2>




















<blockquote>
I want to thank the team for the best IDE I use for six years for
development of personal
finance application ePortfel (www.eportfel.com). <br>
  <br>
Professionally, I used also Eclipse and IntelliJ Idea in other
projects, but never even
thought of switching to any of them with ePortfel. I must admit that I
also very much like Idea for its refactoring capabilities and for many
possibilities it gives for developing multi-tier apps. But for rich
client GUIs, NetBeans has no competition on the market. <br>
  <br>
These are main reasons that make NetBeans best: <br>
  <br>
1. Great GUI builder<br>
2. Great Ant integration (no more hand-keeping consistency between IDE
and separate build
script!)<br>
3. Great and CONSISTENT IDE ui (no more ui mess like in Eclipse)<br>
4. Great IDE speed (faster than Eclipse that liked to freeze my desktop)<br>
5. Great Debugger<br>
6. Great Profiler (easy and effective - you feel like using simple
wizard and get exact
info)<br>
  <br>
And as a summary I have to say I do not have any need for looking for
better tool. I just
have everything in NetBeans - out of the box. </blockquote>

Eclipse Hits The Mat...NetBeans New Champ! </a></i><br>
  <br>
Recently, I have undertaken some changes in my development environment.
This all started when it occurred to me that I was going nowhere fast
trying to do PHP coding with Eclipse's PHPEclipse plugin....NetBeans
was selected to replace Eclipse itself for my Java and Java ME
projects. This made me the most nervous because it can be quite a dance
dealing with Java dependencies, etc. I was afraid I'd have to go
through mountains of tutorials to regain my level of proficiency I had
with Eclipse. <br>
  <br>
Dead wrong. <br>
  <br>
Through the entire process of transitioning my projects over, NEVER
ONCE did I ever have trouble figuring out what to do...and I didn't
look at a single tutorial. The boys at Sun have done an extremely
amazing job of writing an IDE devoid of anything overly cryptic. It
just worked...and perfectly! On top of that, the tool is slick and
clean....<br>
  <br>
My advice to Java developers out there: Give NetBeans a try! You won't
need any training, it's that easy. You will love it!

<h2>David Saintloth, Chief Software Architect, Apriority LLC</h2>















<blockquote>
I have been using NetBeans since the time it was called Forte, way back
in 2001. I enjoyed
the ease with which I could get my project going and really liked the
color coding. That
was about it, I used it for about 6 months before I was forced to work
with JBuilder in
early 2002. <br>
  <br>
Well, JBuilder was okay but it didn't have the intuitive feel that
Forte did.
Forte was replaced by NetBeans, I went through all the major versions
up to 4.2 before the
buzz on this "uber" IDE called Eclipse started up. I decided to
download and install
Eclipse and for the life of me I don't know how anyone could compare
that to Netbeans. By
version 4, Netbeans was incredibly intuitive, stable and offered good
tools for refactoring
(the global search and replace features are a godsend) then came
version 5, then 5.5. I
haven't bothered to use Eclipse since. <br>
  <br>
Code completion, automated javadoc building, automated jar deployment
and the astonishing Profiler make this THE best IDE out there for
developers working on large projects. I am currently working on an
Enterprise scale distributed web application framework with over 200
source files and about 2 dozen import packages and NetBeans has managed
the coding and execution of my work perfectly. I highly recommend
NetBeans to all my coding friends over any alternative when I get the
chance.

<br>
When it comes to IDEs, I've been around. I've used Visual C++ since
version 1.5. Tried other environments over the years, but Visual Studio
was by far the best no matter what other people claimed.
I started using Eclipse since that's what everyone around me was using
for some Java work and I hated it. I'll reserve my thoughts on that for
a future blog post but it was never a comfortable fit for me. Needless
to say, I've converted my entourage from Eclipse to NetBeans now. <br>
<br>
Version 5.5.1 of NetBeans was pretty good... .<br>
NetBeans 6 was simply fantastic... .<br>
NetBeans 6.1 has really been great for me, so great that I've ditched 6
for the 6.1 beta... .<br>
<br>
I won't be switching back to Visual Studio anytime soon. The only real
problem I have with NetBeans is that since everything is in the open
and announced upfront, I find I'm always eager to get my hands on the
next release, never truly satisfied with the current one. I would
imagine however that's a good problem for NetBeans to have.

6.1 IDE (Beta): Prepare to Make the Jump to Light Speed!</span><br>

Visual Studio and Eclipse had best find a shady spot on the side of the
inter-galactic thoroughfare, because the beta version of Sun's NetBeans
integrated development environment is out. And she's running on all
thrusters, Chewie! (Grew up in the Star Wars generation - who, me?)
I've had it on my plate now for some time to begin developing a desktop

ground to this point because of the steep learning curve and heavy
footprint of previous IDEs. <br>
<br>
Not any more! First, I get to the download page and find a beautifully
crafted Web site with a self-explanatory grid and (YES!) links for
bundled installs. So, instead of having to crank down this 900MB
monstrosity (think downloading the ISO image for the Visual Studio
Express tools), I get a 24MB file that installs and starts up in less
than five minutes - no mean feat considering my computer's 3 years old.

The company I work for was looking at developing some large scale
applications for clients. Some of these were new applications and
others were going to be rewrites of existing systems that had stopped
performing. Our choice of NetBeans was really driven by a number of
factors:<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Low cost set up for developers (we only pay when we deploy) <br>
</li>
<li>The IDE is awesome and the development environment Is perfect
for
developing 3 tier client server systems <br>
</li>
<li>We can run multi platform <br>
</li>
<li>We felt there was better support with NetBeans, especially with
in
the virtual world Second Life where a lot of developers meet <br>
</li>
<li>It works perfectly with the 4 different types of database we
have to work with <br>
</li>
<li>Development of web applications and "stand alone" and mobile
apps is all done in one place <br>
</li>
<li>We have no need to copy and paste code around as the code can
be
centralised on the app server <br>
</li>
<li>Using the Sun App server we are able to give 100% uptime to our
clients rather than the standard downtime required by other
applications <br>
</li>
<li>The code completion and documentation is very elegant <br>
</li>
<li>I seem to spend more time dragging and dropping and less time
coding <br>
</li>
<li>Profiling tools are fantastic <br>
</li>
<li>The flexibility of being able to choose different frameworks
and mix
and match them is awesome <br>
</li>
<li>The integration with databases is perfect, very tight and easy.<br>
<br>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I could go on but all
in all I think my message to developers has to be get stuck in to
NetBeans, you won't regret it. Even if you are a .net or VB programmer
it's not that hard to switch any longer and there are a whole bunch of
excellent people willing to provide any assistance you need. (Although
if you are in a commercial environment Sun Developer Support is WELL
worth the money).<br>

I just wanted to say a big THANK YOU to all of you guys for developing
this great IDE! I
have been using MyEclipse for more than two years and two days ago I
decided to give your
IDE a try. I was totally blown away. NetBeans is just so great and
moreover it is for damn free!
I have fired MyEclipse and dumped it into oblivion.

We've been following NetBeans's development for quite some time.... And
with NetBeans 5.5, we decided to give it a shot. Unsurprisingly, we
ended up replacing Eclipse as our Java development environment of
choice with that NetBeans release. Some of the reasons for our switch
to NetBeans 5.5, were:<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>The Matisse GUI builder enabled us to quickly build
good-looking GUI forms. </li>
<li>Robust integrated Java debugger. </li>
<li>Smaller memory footprint. </li>
<li>Faster UI responsiveness. </li>
<li>More active development/frequent release schedule. </li>
<li>More elegant project management. </li>
</ul>
With the release of Netbeans 6.0, the reasons for using NetBeans became
more compelling:<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>Further improvements to the Matisse GUI builder. </li>
<li>Easy-to-use integrated Java profiler. </li>
<li>Cleaner "Plugin" management. </li>
<li>C++ Development... </li>
</ul>
Surprisingly, we also ended up replacing Microsoft Visual Studio .NET
2005 with NetBeans 6.0 for all our C++ development! The default
NetBeans 6.0 C++ Pack contains all the functionality we used in MSVC++
(including the 3rd Party "Visual Assist'' plugin), plus provides us
these additional benefits:<br>
<br>
<ul>
<li>A unified project for all our target C++ platforms (Windows,
Mac OS X Universal Binary, and Linux x86/x64). </li>
<li>The freedom to develop on any platform targeting any other
platform (using NetBeans's "Compiler Collections'' settings with
cross-compilers). </li>
<li>A consistent, unified development environment within which to
develop our complete applications from start to finish; including both
Java and C++ (via JNI) components. </li>
</ul>
The future looks bright for NetBeans, and I can't wait for what
subsequent releases have in store!<br>

With regard to Forte: the last time I've seen a Sun IDE for Java.
NetBeans is a quantum leap. With regard to Eclipse: a three-year
veteran. NetBeans is FAST, POLISHED, &amp; WELL ORGANIZED.<br>
<br>
In particular, I'm impressed by your visual editor, Matisse. Eclipse
Visual Editor is no match for Matisse. Eclipse Visual Editor is so
slow, buggy, and resource intensive - not to mention unsupported in the
current Eclipse version - that I just created all my GUIs by hand.
While I would consider myself proficient at coding Swing and AWT, I
just don't have time to develop 100+ wizards/forms/dialogs etc by hand.
I need to get product out the door while at the same time developing
GUIs that are logical, consistent, attractive, and easier to hand off
to other folks that need to update the code base.<br>
<br>
Keep up the good work!

<h2>Jean-Yves Mengant, CTO, Sefas Innovation </h2>

<blockquote> In order to provide cross platform portability to our
customers, our company has been involved in Java technologies since
1999. Java IDE are one of the most important piece of software for our
developers which have important impacts on development productivity.
This is the reason why after using Jbuilder and Eclipse we definitively
switch to Netbeans since it offers for free the most impressive and
efficient Java development environment available in 2006 and 2007. With
invaluable plugins and features like the matisse GUI design tools and
the integrated profile, it outperforms the Java IDE competition today.
In order to contribute ourselves to the impressive work of the netbeans
team and since Python development is also part of our development
activity, we have developed a Python development plugin environment
available for free in the Netbeans plugin catalog(jpydbg). Thanks again
to the NetBeans team for the great work done.

<h2>Jens Technau, Contact Air</h2>

<blockquote>
Just wanted to express my appreciation for your IDE. I used to develop
with JBuilder
since the very beginning and refused to switch to any other IDE until
Borland said they
eventually stopped working on it. <br>
<br>
This happened by the end of last year. Being the only architect and
developer for the
paperless-cockpit project in our company, I just couldn't afford to
spend more than
one or two days in managing the transition to another IDE. I tried
Eclipse. I soon
realized that there is no GUI Builder worth mentioning. I do the whole
thing including
GUI, so I can`t use any GUI builder below the standard of JBuilder. <br>
<br>
Then I came to see NetBeans with Matisse and the ease of migrating my
J2EE projects.
Today I'm happy that Borland stopped JBuilder because otherwise I would
still work it
without enjoiing the benefits of NetBeans. Please keep on developing
NetBeans!

<h2>Julien Ponge</h2>

Some of you might know that I am more an Eclipse guy than a Netbeans
one. However
one would be blind not to recognize the tremendous amount of effort of
Sun toward
making Netbeans a better IDE. Quite frankly, the competition between
the 2 big players
(Eclipse and Netbeans) is fruitful.
For the moment, I think that Netbeans is strong on J2EE and Swing
development.
Eclipse is not as good if you develop a Swing project, and the J2EE
stuff in WTP
is as good as in Netbeans, but much less straightforward. Eclipse is
also more versatile,
but all of this genericity comes at the price of more customization
before you can
actually work. This is were Netbeans clearly shines when it comes to
doing J2EE development. <br>
<br>
Part of my job is to teach at a French engineering school, and I have
decided that my students will do their J2EE duties with Netbeans. Here
are some reasons why.
<ul>
<li> The Netbeans + Sun Application Server bundle: There is a
full-stack J2EE server integrated
with the IDE out of the box. </li>
<li> Running a webapp is as simple as pressing the start button. It
does everything from starting
the server, reloading the webapp, launching a web browser at the right
URL and so on. </li>
<li> Students don't have to deal with web.xml, or creating the
files in the right place. </li>
<li> NetBeans uses Ant, meaning that the project can be used
outside of Netbeans, too. </li>
<li> There is an embedded database (PointBase), which is very
useful for instance when Oracle
instances are down due to other lab courses. </li>
<li> The editors are reasonably good, and the code completion in
Java classes and JSPs is
always helpful to students. </li>
<li> The JSTL support is very good, there is no reason for teaching
plain-old and ugly
JSPs anymore. </li>
</ul>
With Eclipse, things would have been slightly more difficult: get
Eclipse, get the WTP plug-ins,
get a J2EE server, install it, configure it, integrate it with
Eclipse... I don't mean that
Eclipse is any bad for J2EE development (I actually think the
opposite), but NetBeans is a
clear winner because it is (from 4.1+) simple and works out of the box.
<br>
<br>
If you have to teach J2EE as well, I strongly recommend Netbeans.
Netbeans team: Well done and keep up the good work, you've managed to
change my mind
on your IDE so much that I do enjoy using it for J2EE.

I have been playing with NetBeans 6 since the betas and I have to say
I’m impressed. The work that has been done on the editor is amazing and
you can tell that they are taking cues from IDEA in that regard. For
the kind of development I’ve been doing lately, Struts2/Spring/JPA
webapps, NB RC1-6.0 has been solid....

I just tried NetBeans 5.5 under Linux, plus the VisualWeb Pack, and I
am breathless. I used Eclipse for a long time, and one day, I was
curious and gave NetBeans 5.0 a try, but I still wasn't completely
convinced. Until now.
NetBeans 5.5 is incredible! I want to tear off my T-shirt in joy! The
new website is clear and easy to navigate: I know where to find the IDE
and any packs that I need. The little palette to drag and drop JSF
components in the VisualWeb Pack? Pure bliss! <br>
<p>Original Text: <i>"Je ne sais pas si c'est le bon endroit pour

compris du premier coup d'oeil: On installe l'IDE, plus un ou deux
Packs supplémentaires, si besoin. La petite palette pour
glisser-déposer les composants JSF sur la page web, que du bonheur! Non
seulement ça concurrence sérieusement Eclipse, mais également un IDE
payant comme Visual Studio 2005, que j'utilise par ailleurs... Sans
être connaisseur, j'ai vraiment le sentiment que l'équipe Netbeans a
cravaché dur pour effectuer un sacré bon en avant..."</i></p>

I worked with Oracle JDeveloper for a while because of heavily used
Oracle DB's in our
company. Before Version 10.1.3, it was almost impossible to follow the
concepts and code generation
behind JDeveloper.<br>
<br>
Some months ago, I tried out NetBeans and I was really surprised. Good
and well-documented
tutorials, where the examples are really running without a mistake!!!
Easy to follow
code generation, and all you need to start as a beginner and grow with
the IDE. I also
find quick help in <a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roumen/">Roman Strobl</a>
and the guys around when I had some problems with virtual
forms.<br>
<br>
Go on, you are doing a good work !!

<h2>Akintayo Olusegun Don, Java Developer, Access Solutions, Nigeria</h2>

<blockquote>
I have been developing with Java since 2001. Recently, I was
called upon by a company because they "badly needed a Java developer".
I responded and began the development process using my favorite IDE of
course. The company has several developers all vast in PHP and a little
bit of desktop apps
development, but nothing about Java at all. The first developer I
worked with
noticed the "superb code completion" that exists in Netbeans 5.5. (He
actually said, "I have
to pay for this" when he later saw 6.1's code completion.) Before,
their IDE was Macromedia Dreamweaver. I told him to try NetBeans out
and I installed the PHP plugin for him.
After two days, he did something very crazy - he uninstalled
Dreamweaver, Rapid CSS and
Notepad++. He said he didn't need any other IDE. Before long, two other
developers joined
the NetBeans campaign. One day I come in with NetBeans 6.0 with SVG
plugin; this
literally blew their minds. They have been toying with SVG for some
time and now they
have not just an IDE but superb code completion. (Code completion seems
to be
their motto now.) With NetBeans 6.1, even the most adept of them all,
fully committed to
Dreamweaver before, now uses NetBeans alongside Dreamweaver. Please
note that this is not a slight to Dreamweaver - its a super IDE, the
best in its class. But these developers
now feel that NetBeans is definitely not in that class - it belongs to
a higher class. The good
thing about all this is that they aint paying a dime for it. <br>
<br>
If you have not used NetBeans, go try it out. I have used Intelli J,
Eclipse, JBuilder and
I must say that the best of them all is NetBeans.
