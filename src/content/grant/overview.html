<H2>Overview</H2>
<p>
The NetBeans Innovators Grant is a process to provide grants to developers or teams of developers to work on an open source project. A total of 10 large projects will be chosen and awarded a grant of US$ 11,500 dollars. Another 10 smaller projects will be chosen and awarded a grant of US$ 2,000 dollars. Awards will only be awarded upon actual project completion. Projects that excel may receive one of two possible gold awards of US$ 11,000 dollars or two possible silver awards of US$ 5,000 dollars. <br>
<p>You can submit a project proposal -- your ideas of how to improve the NetBeans Project -- and a panel of experts will assign to the best proposals a money grant. Once you have a grant approved,  you know that you'll receive the money if you complete the project. You can then work on a module, develop an application on top of the NetBeans Platform, fix bugs on the NetBeans IDE or even work on missing documentation or translations. Whatever you think is needed to increase NetBeans adoption and push the NetBeans Project to its next level. And you'll get real money -- at least US$ 11,500 or 2,000! -- to work on your dream open source project! <br>
<p>Come work on a great project -- your project, your ideas -- and get paid to do it. NetBeans is a Java-based, open source project, that includes both a full featured IDE and a strong extensible platform to create desktop applications. There are many cool projects and ideas that you can build on top of NetBeans, and we want to see what you have in mind. Do you have a great idea that will help other developers be more productive? Do you want the chance to create the next breakthrough in software development? Do you want to make it even easier to develop desktop applications? Wouldn't it be great to be paid to work on your own project? This is your chance, come submit your proposals to the Dreams of Reality: NetBeans Innovators Grant.<br>
