<h2>20 Projects selected for the Grant Announced!</h2>
April 14th, 2008<br/><br/>

<div style="float:left;width:50%"><b>Large projects</b>
<p><ul>
  <li>CashForward (Bill Snyder)
<blockquote><em>CashForward is money management Swing application built on the NetBeans platform.  We expect CashForward to provide a solid example
of how to use the NetBeans Rich Client platform for real-world
applications.</em></blockquote></li>
  <li>Cube°n (Anuradha Gunasekara)
<blockquote><em>Cube°n makes tasks a first class part of NetBeans by integrating with
an issue tracking system.  It then monitors your work activity to
identify what's relevant and improves productivity by reducing
searching, scrolling, navigation and sharing expertise.  Support for
integration with JIRA is planned initially, but the abstraction layer
will facilitate support of other repositories such as Bugzilla and
Trac in the future.</em></blockquote></li>
  <li>JavaSpaces (Magdalena Dukielska)
<blockquote><em>This project will provide plugins that make working with JavaSpaces in
NetBeans easy -- even for beginners.  These plugins will let
developers concentrate on logic of the program instead of tinkering
with the JavaSpaces technology itself.
</em></blockquote></li>
  <li>IvyBeans (Laurent Forêt)
<blockquote><em>IvyBeans will provide full Apache Ivy integration into the library
management feature of the NetBeans IDE.  This includes support for
managing and downloading dependencies, setting the project classpath
and editing the relevant configuration files used by Ivy.
</em></blockquote></li>
  <li>NB Project (Alessandro Dourado)
<blockquote><em>This project will create a software projects management tool based on
the NetBeans platform using a client/server architecture and a
database to support use by the developers on a team as well as their
manager.  It will support task definition, resource management and
project status reporting.
</em></blockquote></li>
  <li>NB-XUL (Aditya Kumar Sharma)
<blockquote><em>This project will add support to NetBeans for designing user
interfaces using Mozilla's XML User Interface Language (XUL).  This
support will include an XUL Editor with code completion, syntax
highlighting, code folding and a structural view as well as a debugger
and wizards that will help you create XUL applications with ease and
speed.
</em></blockquote></li>
  <li>NetBeans Spot/Sun SPOT Plugin (Thiago Galbiatti Vespa)
<blockquote><em>This plugin will give the NetBeans Platform the ability to integrate
the Sun Spot access interface through a wireless network, a gateway,
or by using a Sun Spot emulator.
</em></blockquote></li>
  <li>NbPython (Allan Davis)
<blockquote><em>nbPython will add first class support for the Python language to the
NetBeans IDE, similar to how the IDE already supports the Ruby
language.</em></blockquote></li>
  <li>Scala Support (Caoyuan Deng)
<blockquote><em>This project will provide an integrated development environment for
building, running, testing, and debugging Scala applications.</em></blockquote></li>
  <li>Visual JavaFX (Adam Kędziora)
<blockquote><em>The goal of this project is to create a visual editor for JavaFX,
complete with vector-based drawing tools, support for generating
JavaFX applets, creating animations and more.</em></blockquote></li>
</ul></p>
</div>

<div style="float:left;width:50%"><b>Small projects</b>
<p><ul>
  <li>CoffeeDregs (Kees Huizing)
<blockquote><em>CoffeeDregs is a tool that visualizes step by step the execution of an
arbitrary Java program.  This tool is aimed at students and will allow
them to step line by line through their code to visual program
execution.  In contrast to a debugger, this tool visually renders the
objects including fields and currently active methods calls.
</em></blockquote></li>
  <li>JSpree (ManiKanta G)
<blockquote><em>This module will provide a full reference library for JavaScript,
including the details of browser implementations of all objects and
methods.  It will also support adding custom code snippets, allowing a
developer to simply drag & drop their snippets into an editor.
</em></blockquote></li>
  <li>Netbeans Update Service (Mark Ashworth)
<blockquote><em>This project aims to make it easy to set up a central server for
mirroring the NetBeans Update Center on a corporate network.  This
will allow developers without Internet access to keep their IDEs
updated while also saving bandwidth.
</em></blockquote></li>
  <li>MONOH (Carlos Oliveira)
<blockquote><em>MONOH will add voice response to the NetBeans IDE.  This will allow
users to configure it to recognize a word or even a whole sentence
that will trigger an action.  That action might open a project, run an
application or even create a new Java class.
</em></blockquote></li>
  <li>Numbered Bookmarks (M.A.S. Jayasundara)
<blockquote><em>The Numbered Bookmarks plugin will allow users to reference bookmarks
in their files by number instead of having to cycle through them to
find one, and will support navigation among bookmarks in different
files. Users will be able to switch between the default behavior and
Numbered Bookmarks.
</em></blockquote></li>
  <li>PDFViewer (Steve Tzou)
<blockquote><em>This project will use Sun's PDF Renderer library to add built-in
support for viewing PDF documents right inside the NetBeans IDE.
</em></blockquote></li>
  <li>PL/SQL Editor (Alexandre Soumbatov)
<blockquote><em>This project will add support for editing Oracle PL/SQL right inside
the NetBeans IDE, including syntax highlighting, code folding and
indentation.
</em></blockquote></li>
  <li>Project Darkstar Tools and Mobility Support (Karel Herink)
<blockquote><em> Project Darkstar has great potential to revolutionize massively
multi-player online game development and we intend to make developing
for it easier by creating a plugin for the NetBeans IDE.
</em></blockquote></li>
  <li>Regular Expressions Module (Angad Singh)
<blockquote><em>This project aims to create a simple and easy to use all-in-one
solution for helping developers in all aspects of working with regular
expressions in NetBeans, including learning, building, testing,
debugging, visualizing, profiling, analysing, organizing,
searching and sharing regular expressions.
</em></blockquote></li>
  <li>Resource Bundle Editor (Denis Stepanov)
<blockquote><em>This project will add improved support for editing resource bundles in
the NetBeans IDE, including sorting, grouping, searching properties as
well as detection of unused properties.
</em></blockquote></li>
