<h1>NetBeans Innovators Grant Contest</h1>
<br>
<h2>Dream Projects Become Reality - Innovators Grant Contest Winners
Announced!<br>
</h2>
September 29, 2008<br>
<br>
Eight months and 170+ submitted project proposals later, we present
the winners of the NetBeans Innovators Grant contest!<br>
<br>
Launched in February 2008, the NetBeans Innovators Grant contest was
part of Sun Microsystems initiative to
give US$ 1 million to open source developers worldwide to work
on their favorite Sun-sponsored project. <br>
<br>
Getting paid to develop a
dream project or idea that could be of use to other developers? The
response from the NetBeans community was immediate! A panel of experts
from the NetBeans Dream Team was tasked to evaluate the best proposals.
20 projects were selected and their developers assigned mentors from
the NetBeans Dream Team and the NetBeans Engineering Team. After months
of development and feedback, 13 projects were completed, reviewed by
the panel and approved for the grant awards.<br>

<h2>Quotes about Gold &amp; Silver Award Projects from Members of the
NetBeans Dream Team and NetBeans Engineering Team</h2>
<h4>About Scala Language Support, Gold Award Medalist</h4>
<p><i>"The Scala Language Support is a very complex contribution which
provides the NetBeans IDE with everything needed to develop an
application in the Scala programming language."</i></p>
<p align="right"><b><i>Tomas Zezula</i>, NetBeans Java Infrastructure
Software Engineer</b></p>
<hr>
<h4>About Cube°n, Gold Award Medalist</h4>
<p><i>"Cube°n brings task focused development to NetBeans 6.5. It is
heavily influenced by the popular Eclipse Mylyn plugin, which some say
is Eclipse's killer feature. The first release comes with support for
the JIRA issue tracker, and there are future plans to support
IssueZilla, Bugzilla and XPlanner. Anyone interested in this plugin is
encouraged to install it and provide feedback to the developer."</i></p>
<p align="right"><b><i>Ryan de Laplante</i>, NetBeans Dream Team member</b></p>
<hr>
<h4>About ivyBeans, Silver Award Medalist</h4>
<p><i>"IvyBeans brings simple and quick project dependency management
to the Ant based NetBeans projects. It really simplifies the task of
piecing together an application from existing library repositories.
This is especially useful when using well known open-source libraries,
but can simplify the task for any commercial project just the same.
Find a library, add it to your project, it along with all dependencies
are immediately available to your project without any other project
configuration from the developer. What more could you ask?"</i></p>
<p align="right"><b><i>Wade Chandler</i>, NetBeans Dream Team member</b></p>
<hr>
<h4>About PL/SQL Editor, Silver Award Medalist</h4>
<p><i>"PL/SQL Editor is a small but well featured module which makes it
possible for Oracle advocates to have good level support for PL/SQL
syntax and popular objects management inside their favorite Java IDE."</i></p>
<p align="right"><b><i>Masoud Kalali</i>, NetBeans Dream Team member</b></p>
<br>
<p><i>"The PL/SQL Editor brings Oracle database development to
NetBeans. It's easy to use, and looks to provide a better experience
for Oracle users inside the NetBeans IDE. It has a ways to go, but with
work progressing, look for this project to make Oracle development in
NetBeans a piece of cake. It looks very promising, and I'm looking
forward to its future."</i></p>
