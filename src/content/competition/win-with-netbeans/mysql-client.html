<h1>Making a simple MySQL client in NetBeans</h1>
<div class="articledate" style="margin-left:0px;">Contributed by Miki Shimizu as part of the <a href="../../competition/win-with-netbeans.html">Win With NetBeans</a> comptetition</div></p>

<p>NetBeans has a nice interface to connect DB, but many SQL commands are to be 
  input as a whole sentence I made Swing application for inserting and viewing 
  data to a table of MySQL database. The sample is very simple, available for 
  one specific table and without deleting or updating operation, It would be extended 
  but the document would be longer and more complicated, I'm afraid.</p>

<h2><a name="db01"></a>Connecting to MySQL database</h2>
<p>I expect that the readers already have a suitable environment of MySQL database 
  server working, having a database with an enough grant to a given user. In this 
  sample,</p>

<p><b>database name: nonidb<br>
  user: noniko<br>
  password: (blank) </b>&lt;- because it's a merely a sample at all. If you have 
  some important data, please set a proper password!</p>
<p>Also, you would get a JDBC driver file for MySQL. I prepared <b>mysql-connector-java-3.1.6-bin.jar</b> 
  file through <a href="http://dev.mysql.com">MySQL developer's web site</a>.</p>
<p>Now, let's go to NetBeans. Click the &quot;Runtime&quot; tab to switch the 
  window you may usually see &quot;Projects&quot; or &quot;Files&quot; window.</p>

<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/adddriver.png" width="357" height="205"></p>
<p><b>Select &quot;Add Driver&quot; in Runtime Window</b></p>
<p>You will find &quot;Databases&quot; node here. open this node to get &quot;Drivers&quot; 
  node under it. If you open more to show the content of &quot;Drivers&quot;, 
  you will find only &quot;JDBC-ODBC&quot;. The first thing to do is add MySQL 
  driver. Right-click the &quot;Drivers&quot; node to show context menu and select 
  &quot;Add Driver&quot;. </p>

<p>Then the setting window appears.</p>
<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/selectdriver.png" width="560" height="343"></p>
<p><b>Find the location of JDBC driver file.</b></p>
<p>By clicking &quot;Add&quot; button you can search the driver file graphically. 
  As the case above, I prepared D:\nonidata\nb4worksnew folder for contain project 
  folders and lib subfolder to contain library files.</p>
<p>If you select the driver file's location , Driver Class and Name are set automatically. 
  In the case of MySQL JDBC driver, the old class name is set first. but click 
  &quot;Find&quot; button, then the progress bar below became active and finally 
  &quot;Searching for driver classes finished&quot; is shown.</p>

<p>Then open the combo of &quot;Driver Class&quot; setting. you can select the 
  current class name of the JDBC Driver.</p>
<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/newdrivername.png" width="355" height="109"></p>
<p><b>Change class name to that of current version.</b></p>
<p>Click &quot;OK&quot;, then the new driver node is added under &quot;Driver&quot; 
  node. Right-click it to select &quot;Connect Using..&quot; from context menu.</p>

<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/connectusing.png" width="302" height="71"> </p>
<p><b>Select &quot;Connect Using...&quot; from context menu</b></p>
<p>The setting window appears. Here Database URL, User Name and Password are needed 
  ( In this case Password is blank).Click OK then you could see &quot;Connection 
  established&quot; message in the progress bar below. The page might be switched 
  to &quot;Advanced&quot;, but in this case there is no advanced setting needed.</p>
<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/conestablished.png" width="419" height="266"></p>
<p>After the connection established, a node for this connection is appeared. Let's 
  proceed to next step .</p>


<h2><a name="db01"></a>Creating a sample table</h2>
Right-Click the node for the connection established above, Select &quot;Create 
Table...&quot;. 
<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/createtable.png" width="335" height="132"></p>
<p><b>Select &quot;Create Table&quot; from context menu</b></p>
<p>Then a window appears for setting the table to create. To display the required 
  setting this window might have to be expanded manually. The important settings 
  are Key, Column name, Data type and Size, depending on the Data type.</p>
<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/cartable.png" width="740" height="281"></p>
<p><b>Creating a table in NetBeans</b></p>

<p>In this case I made a sample table &quot;<b>cars</b>&quot; having <b>carid</b>, 
  <b>name</b>, <b>vendor</b> and <b>type</b> as fields. the field carid is the 
  primary key. All the fields have data type of VARCHAR. Only carid has 10 for 
  size and all others have 20.</p>
<p>Once the table created, you can see its node under the connection node. The 
  structure of the table &quot;cars&quot; are displayed.</p>

<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/cartablestruct.png" width="353" height="236"></p>
<p><b>The node tree of the table created</b></p>

<h2><a name="db03"></a>Insert the first data </h2>
<p>Now let's insert the first row by sending SQL command. Right-Click any node 
  under the connection node to display &quot;Execute Commands...&quot;menu item.</p>
<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/execommand.png" width="309" height="116"></p>
<p>Then the large window of operating command appears at the same place of source 
  editor. Too large, so I will not show the screenshot of the whole appearance. 
  The important spots are, first of all, the text area for inputting command.</p>
<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/firstcmd.png" width="463" height="67"></p>
<p><b>Input a whole command sentence.</b></p>
<p>Click &quot;Execute&quot; button and, if the command is valid, you can see 
  the &quot;Command successfully excuted&quot; message below. More to make sure, 
  right-click the &quot;cars&quot; node and select &quot;View data&quot;.</p>

<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/viewdata.png" width="264" height="153"></p>
<p><b>Right-Click the &quot;cars&quot; node to view data.</b></p>
<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/firstviewdata.png" width="308" height="78"></p>
<p><b>First data inserted</b></p>
<p>Yeah! The first data were successfully inserted. But you might think the whole 
  sentence &quot;insert into...&quot; bothering. I did. So I made up mind to build 
  an application to insert data by more graphical operation.</p>

<h2><a name="db04"></a>Creating a new Java Project</h2>

<p>Let's create a new Java Project for the application. Select from Menu bar &quot;File&quot;-&gt;&quot;New 
  Project&quot;. In the new project wizard, select &quot;General&quot;-&gt;&quot;Java 
  Application&quot; as the project type. In my case the project name was &quot;mysqloperation&quot; 
  and the location was &quot;d:\nonidata\nb4worksnew\mysqloperation&quot;. Check 
  off &quot;create main project&quot;.</p>

<p>After creating the project, create new package. In my case, &quot;mysqlop&quot;.</p>

<h2><a name="db05"></a>Creating a utility class for connecting database</h2>
<p>Operation of database in Java is very complicated, requiring connection, statement, 
  resultset and many try&amp;catch. So I used a utility class dealing with such 
  operation.</p>
<p>The whole code is shown here, <a href="https://netbeans.org/files/documents/4/297/MyDBConnection.java" target="_blank">MyDBConnection.java.</a></p>
<p><b>init()</b> method is for connecting MySQL database.</p>

<p><b>getConnection()</b> method is to be called after init()method, to give to 
  the other class the established connection.</p>
<p>two <b>close() </b>methods and <b>destroy()</b> methods are for settling the 
  end of operation. Closing connection, statement or resultset requires try&amp;catch 
  so they have been extracted here.</p>
<p>To use this file, classpath to the JDBC driver must be set for this project. 
  Right-click the &quot;<b>mysqloperation</b>&quot; project and select &quot;Properties...&quot; 
  from the context menu. In the &quot;Project Properties&quot; window, select 
  &quot;Build&quot;-&gt;&quot;Compiling Sources&quot;.Click &quot;Add JAR/Folder...&quot; 
  button near the &quot;Classpath for Compiling Source&quot; setting , so you 
  can search the location of the JDBC jar file.</p>

<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/addlibrary.png" width="745" height="249"></p>
<p><b>Adding JDBC jar file to classpath</b></p>

<h2><a name="db06"></a>Creating the Table Model</h2>
<p>Then I prepared a cusomized Table Model for the JTable to use in this app.</p>
<p>The whole code is shown here, <a href="https://netbeans.org/files/documents/4/298/CarTableModel.java" target="_blank">CarTableModel.java</a>.</p>
<p>To write this code I used some nice tools of NetBeans. <br>
  First, create a new Java Class file named CarTableModel.java. It has a very 
  plain and empty template, just with package and class declaration. </p>

<p><br>
  Edit manually the class declaration to extend &quot;AbstractTableModel&quot; 
  class. The editor soon show the red and waved underline to show errors. One 
  cause of this is lack of importing &quot;javax.swing.table.AbstractTableModel&quot; 
  class. This error is fixed by right-clicking somewhere of the code and select 
  &quot;Fix Imports&quot;.</p>
<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/fiximports.png" width="483" height="139"></p>
<p><b>Use &quot;Fix imports&quot; tool</b></p>

<p>You can check the declaration</p>
<p><b>import javax.swing.table.AbstractTableModel;</b></p>
<p>has been inserted near the top of the source code.</p>
<p>But still the red underline remains. The remaining cause of this is lack of 
  implementation of proper abstract methods.<br>
  This is fixed by &quot;overriding method&quot; tool invoked this way...</p>
<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/toolovmethods.png" width="455" height="267"></p>
<p><b>Use &quot;Overrice Methods&quot; tool</b></p>

<p>The required implementations are extracted checking &quot;Show Abstract Methods 
  Only&quot;. </p>
<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/overridelist.png" width="484" height="197"></p>
<p><b>Required implementations are listed</b></p>
<p>Select all of the three methods by clicking the node and &quot;OK&quot;.</p>
<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/methodimplemented.png" width="436" height="421"></p>
<p><b>Required implementations are inserted automatically</b></p>
<p>Now the red line is gone! </p>
<p>In fact, we also need to override <b>getColumnName</b>(int param) method, otherwise 
  we couldn't get customized headders of the table.</p>

<p>Let's fill the contents.<br>
  The code is specified to access the specific table &quot;cars&quot;, so the 
  number of column is fixed to 4. <br>
  Each column's name is also known and can be set directly.</p>
<p>This time I used Generics, a new feature of JDK5.0, for the first time. It 
  worked successfully in NB (Clap hands!)<br>
</p>

<h2><a name="db07"></a>Creating the JFrame Form class-the Form design</h2>
<p>Now let's create the JFrame Form Application, The main class of this project! 
  &quot;JFrame Form&quot; can be selected in the new wizard. The name is &quot;InsertTable&quot; 
  in my case, which created a source file &quot;InsertTable.java&quot;.</p>

<p>First, design the form. It should be take a vertically long window, so I fixed 
  the form size instead of use &quot;packing&quot;.<br>
  Select &quot;JFrame&quot; node in the Inspector window to show its properties. 
  Change &quot;Form Size Policy&quot; from default &quot;Generate pack()&quot; 
  to &quot;Generate Resize Code&quot;.</p>

<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/resizeform.png" width="275" height="282"></p>
<p><b>To fix the Form size.</b></p>
<p>Then &quot;Form Size&quot; property becomes editable. Edit it as:</p>
<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/resized.png" width="182" height="19"></p>
<p><b>The Form size edited.</b></p>
<p>This form will be separated vertically into three parts:</p>
<p>(1)JTextfields orJComboBox to input the new data.<br>
  (2)JButton to send data and show message.<br>

  (3)The JTable.</p>
<p>The first two should be located on eachJPanel, and the JTable on a JScrollPane. 
  This is the basic parts.</p>
<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/panelspanes.png" width="276" height="193"></p>
<p><b>JPanels and JScrollPane to locate the components.</b></p>
<p>Notice the vertical positions of the nodes don't mean their actual locations. 
  I mean, dataPanel, sendPanel and tablePane are located to North, Center and 
  South of BorderLayout, respectively.</p>
<p>On dataPanel, 3JTextFields and one JComboBox to input data and 4JLabels for 
  explanations should be located. I decided GridLayout is the best to set these 
  locations. The default layout onJPanel is FlowLayout in NetBeans. It must be 
  changed:</p>
<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/setlayout.png" width="343" height="262"> </p>
<p><b>Change to GridLayout</b></p>
<p>Then properties of this GridLayout is displayed. Set colunm number to 2, row 
  number to 4.</p>

<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/griddata.png" width="190" height="112"></p>
<p>Then locate the components. they could be moved by drag and drop on the form, 
  If you are not satisfied with the location.</p>
<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/griddragdrop.png" width="412" height="97"></p>
<p><b>Moving the JComboBox within the GridLayout.</b></p>
<p>The component might escape to a very wrong position, as a different panel. 
  Don't worry, you can move its location by drag and drop within the Inspector 
  window, too.</p>
<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/inspectordragdrop.png" width="276" height="226"></p>
<p><b>Moving the JComboBox within the Inspector window</b>.</p>
<p>After all components are set, customize their name to show their roles.<br>
  Also customize text property of each JLabel, and eraze that of each JTextField. 
  Here is an example of editing &quot;text&quot; property of JLabel:</p>

<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/labeltxt.png" width="277" height="130"></p>
<p><b>Customizing &quot;text&quot; property to show &quot;ID:&quot;as JLabel</b></p>
<p>Then sendPanel to locate JButton and and JLabel. Also GridLayout is set for 
  this JPanel, with 1 column and two rows. The name and &quot;text&quot; property 
  are customized.</p>
<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/sendpnlcmpns.png" width="203" height="76"></p>
<p>In this way the components, other than JTable, arearranged as below:</p>
<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/firstguisetting.png" width="402" height="271"></p>

<p><b>Components without JTable has been customized</b>.</p>

<h2><a name="db08"></a>Customizing JTable</h2>
<p>As shown above, at this point the JTable has 4x4 structure and empty data. 
  Let's customize it to show the content of the table &quot;cars&quot; of MySQL 
  database.</p>
<p>Select the JTable now is named &quot;carTable&quot; in the Inspector window 
  to show its properties. Find the &quot;model&quot; property and click the &quot;...&quot; 
  button at the right edge .</p>

<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/tablemodelprop.png" width="275" height="213"></p>
<p><b>carTable and its &quot;model&quot; property</b></p>
<p>Then the editor window appears. The default 4x4 structure is set in this window. 
  Let's change &quot;<b>Select Mode</b>&quot; from &quot;TableModelEditor&quot; 
  to &quot;<b>FormConnection</b>&quot;.</p>
<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/selectformcon.png" width="640" height="260"></p>

<p><b>Switching from default Table Model Editor to Form Connection mode</b>.</p>
<p>In the Form Connection mode, Click the radio of &quot;User Code&quot; in the 
  option window. </p>
<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/usercodezero.png" width="639" height="273"></p>
<p><b>Form Connection mode</b></p>
<p>Then look at the bottom of this window. The &quot;Advanced&quot; button is 
  there. Click it!</p>
<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/advancedbtn.png" width="115" height="36"></p>

<p><b>&quot;Advanced&quot; button at the bottom of the window</b></p>
<p>A window appears to edit before and after the code of setting the TableModel 
  for the JTable. This time check both to edit .</p>
<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/advancedcode.png" width="358" height="381"></p>
<p>The method named getResultFromCars should be created in the source code of 
  &quot;InsertTable.java&quot; manually like</p>
<pre class='examplecode'><font color="#660000">
 public ResultSet getResultFromCars() {
        
        ResultSet rs=null;
        
        try{
            rs=stmt.executeQuery("Select * from cars");
        
        }
        catch(SQLException e){}
        
        return rs;
        
    }</font></pre>
<p>Click OK to return the &quot;User Code&quot; to fill.</p>

<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/setusermodel.png" width="263" height="47"></p>
<p>Note that here semicolon&quot;;&quot; to terminate the sentence SHOUD NOT BE 
  input. Why? check the source code. Check the <b>InitComponents()</b> method. 
  Here!</p>
<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/insertedtobluearea.png" width="289" height="61"></p>
<p>Light-blue &quot;Protected&quot;&quot;Uneditable&quot; area? Who said so? Ho-ho-ho! 
  You can edit frrreely by this means prepared by NetBeans!</p>


<h2><a name="db09"></a>First running of InsertTable</h2>
<p>To make a first test run of this customized JTable, we still have something 
  to do. First, declaration.</p>
<p> <font color="#660000">private MyDBConnection mdbc;<br>
  private java.sql.Statement stmt;</font></p>
<p>They are to be written somewhere in the source. Near the EOF, close to other 
  variables, would be nice.</p>
<p>Then the constructor. Note that we should add throw declaration to it</p>
<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/exceptionconstruct.png" width="276" height="22"></p>
<p>to avoid that annoying compile error &quot;java.sql.SQLException is not reported...&quot;.</p>

<p>The whole content of the constructor is :</p>
<pre class='examplecode'><font color="#660000"> 
public InsertTable() throws  Exception{
        
         mdbc=new MyDBConnection();
         mdbc.init();
         Connection conn=mdbc.getMyConnection();
         stmt= conn.createStatement();
        
        initComponents();
    }

</font> </pre>
<p>One more to avoid the same compile error. Edit the main method prepared by 
  NetBeans: </p>
<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/trycatchinmain.png" width="373" height="197"></p>
<p><b>Add try-catch to the main method </b></p>
<p>Now let's run the project! An window to select main class might be appear. 
  In the list you will find only this &quot;InsertTable.class&quot;. Select it.</p>
<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/tableshown.png" width="399" height="222"></p>
<p><b>The tabledata of MySQL was shown</b></p>

<p>The only one row existing in &quot;cars&quot; table of MySQL database has been 
  displayed!</p>

<h2><a name="db10"></a>Taking a little care...</h2>
<p>Now that we could display existing data from MySQL to JTable, Let's feel settled 
  and take a little care for better application.</p>
<p>One thing is a proper termination of this application, All the sessions with 
  MySQL(connection, statement, resultsets) must be closed.<br>
  This application is terminated by closing the window. So we should add an event 
  processing method for WindowClosing event. <br>
  Select &quot;JFrame&quot; in the Inspector window to show its properties window, 
  and then click &quot;events&quot; to switch the page. Find &quot;windowClosing&quot; 
  event. It is set to be &lt;none&gt; by default, but when you click the word 
  &lt;none&gt;, it would be changed automatically to &quot;formWindowClosing&quot;...press 
  the Enter key while this row is selected.</p>

<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/windowclosing.png" width="288" height="332"></p>
<p><b>Setting windowClosing event of JFrame </b></p>
<p>Then the source code appears to enable to edit the method.</p>
<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/windowclosingcode.png" width="452" height="93"></p>
<p><b>Edit &quot;formWindowClosing&quot; method</b></p>
<p>Close the statement and the connection.</p>
<p>The other thing is to set items of the JComboBox named <b>typeCombo</b>. Yes, 
  it should be equipped to select drive type of a car.</p>

<p>Select &quot;typeCombo&quot; node in the Inspector Window to show its properties. 
  Find &quot;<b>model</b>&quot; property and click &quot;...&quot; button on the 
  right edge, just like we did for setting the TableModel for JTable.<br>
  A window appears, This time we use the default<b> ComboBoxModelEditor</b>.</p>

<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/itemconbo.png" width="454" height="284"></p>
<p>Input a new item in &quot;Item:&quot; field and click &quot;Add&quot; button. 
  That's easy! I prepared the items &quot;FF&quot;, &quot;FR&quot;, &quot;MR&quot; 
  and&quot;4WD&quot; as drive type. Are there anything else?</p>


<h2><a name="db11"></a>Inserting data to MySQL</h2>
<p>The finishing spurt! Inserting data to MySQL should be done at the clicking 
  &quot;Send&quot; button(the JButton named &quot;<b>sendButton</b>&quot;).</p>
<p>In NetBeans' GUI Editor, it's very easy to make event processing method for 
  JButton. Just double-click the JButton itself on the form.</p>
<p>The <b>&quot;sendButtonActionPerformed&quot;</b> method<b> </b>is created in 
  the source file. Let's fill the content as this:</p>

<pre class='examplecode'><font color="#660000">private void sendButtonActionPerformed(java.awt.event.ActionEvent evt) {<font color="#006600">//GEN-FIRST:event_sendButtonActionPerformed
        // TODO add your handling code here:</font>
        
        String carid=idField.getText();
        String name=nameField.getText();        
        String vendor=vendorField.getText();
        String type=(String)typeCombo.getSelectedItem();
        
        String insertStr="";
        
        try{
            
            insertStr="insert into cars (carid, name, vendor, type) values("
                    +<b>quotate</b>(carid)+","
                    +quotate(name)+","
                    +quotate(vendor)+","
                    +quotate(type)
                    +")";
            
            int done=stmt.executeUpdate(insertStr);
            
            commentLabel.setText("1 row inserted");
           
            <b>getContentPane().removeAll();
            initComponents();</b>
        
        }
        catch(Exception e){
            commentLabel.setText("Error occurred in inserting data");
            e.printStackTrace();
        }
        
    }</font><font color="#006600">//GEN-LAST:event_sendButtonActionPerformed</font>
</pre>
<p>Note that <b>initComponents</b> method is called after inserting data, and 
  after <b>removing the current comtent pane</b>.It's necessary to refresh the 
  JTable's appearance...If I were skilled more, I could refresh only JTable, instead 
  of the whole container. This is, as is called in Japanese a way like &quot;Chopping 
  tofu with the axe&quot;. Sorry!</p>

<p>Also note here the <b>quotate</b> method is called. I created it not to hit 
  so many quotation marks:</p>
<pre class='examplecode'> <font color="#660000">public String quotate(String content){<br>    <br>        return &quot;'&quot;+content+&quot;'&quot;;<br>    }</font>

</pre>
<p>Now the whole code for<a href="https://netbeans.org/files/documents/4/299/InsertTable.java"> InsertTable.java</a>. </p>
<p>Run the project! Input data and click the &quot;Send&quot; button. Now you 
  can see another row just inserted in the JTable. Repeat inserting a few more!</p>

<p><b>Operating the completed application</b></p>
<p>...And let's make sure these data will be viewed also from NetBeans' utility.</p>
<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/resultconfirmed.png" width="307" height="106"></p>

<p>Tough work! But through this project we have learned:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How to operate database from NetBeans's utility</li>
  <li>How to edit the &quot;protected&quot; codes in the light-blue area</li>
  <li>How to use customized TableModel for JTable</li>
</ul>
<p>...and so on.</p>
