<p>An introduction to creating source code faster with less typing using NetBeans 4.0.
</p>

		<h2>Preface</h2>

		<p>
			<img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/keyboard.png" class="align-right" vspace="5" hspace="20"/>
			Did you know that the keys on a standard
			keyboard are deliberately laid out in a way which slows down your typing? They
			are. This layout, called the QWERTY layout, was originally chosen for the first
			typewriter in 1872 because it kept people from typing so fast the mechanical type
			bars would collide.
		</p>

		<p>
			This is just one of many reasons why you
			should stop typing your source code, or rather, why you should let NetBeans create
			the source code for you. This article contains a series of tips on how you can
			write source code faster with NetBeans 4.0 using as little keyboard input as
			possible.
		</p>
<p></p>
		<h2>Tips</h2>

		<h3>Tip 1: Use Word Matching</h3>

		<p>
			Once you have typed a word in a source file
			you can retype this word anywhere by entering the first few letters of it followed
			by pressing Ctrl+K. This feature is called word matching and it works by
			looking for words which start with the letters you have just typed. Ctrl+K
			looks upwards in your source file and Ctrl+L looks downwards.
		</p>

		<p>Once you have written the for loop shown below</p>

<pre class="examplecode">
for(Person person : personSet) {

}
</pre>

		<p>
			which iterates through a set of persons, you
			can place your cursor between the curly braces and type &quot;pe&quot; followed by pressing
			Ctrl+K. NetBeans will immediately suggest the word &quot;personSet&quot; as it is the
			nearest word which starts with &quot;pe&quot;, and pressing Ctrl+K a second time will
			make NetBeans suggest &quot;person&quot; which is the second nearest word.
		</p>

		<p>
			In fact, in this special case you do not
			even have to type &quot;pe&quot; � just pressing Ctrl+K inside the loop will also automatically
			type the identifiers &quot;personSet&quot; and &quot;person&quot;; this works because these two identifiers
			are the first words encountered when NetBeans searches upwards in the source
			file. However, had you written ten words between the top of the loop and the
			cursor, just pressing Ctrl+K would make NetBeans cycle through all those ten words
			before finally suggesting &quot;personSet&quot; and then &quot;person&quot;. In this case, typing &quot;pe&quot;
			before pressing Ctrl+K helps by making NetBeans skip all words which do not
			start with &quot;pe&quot;.
		</p>

		<p>
			Should you accidentally press Ctrl+K too
			many times and reach a word which is placed before the word you want, just
			press Ctrl+L a few times and NetBeans will move onwards to the word you missed.
			Finally take note that this feature works everywhere in all kinds of files � in
			fact it is quite handy in XML files where you can use it to type the names of
			tags already present in the file.
		</p>

		<h3>Tip 2: Create an Identifier Macro</h3>

		<p>
			Writing long identifier names makes code
			more readable. Remembering that an identifier called &quot;i&quot; actually identifies an
			instance of type &quot;Invoice&quot; and not an &quot;Iterator&quot; or an &quot;ItemListener&quot; can be hard,
			especially in lengthy methods; if it had not been for all the typing involved, a
			name like &quot;invoice&quot; would have been a better choice. Now, if only we could make
			NetBeans write &quot;invoice&quot; for us, there would be no reason to choose
			&quot;i&quot;. This section presents a macro which does just that.
		</p>

		<p>
			Imagine the cursor is placed right after &quot;Invoice&quot; (denoted with a &quot;|&quot;) in the
			code below:
		</p>
<pre class="examplecode">
public class Order {
	public void setInvoice(Invoice |) {

	}
}
</pre>

		<p>
			When triggering
			the macro NetBeans will automatically
			type &quot;invoice&quot; by using the type
			name &quot;Invoice&quot; already present in your code. The macro simply retypes the
			previous word and changes the first letter of the retyped word to lower case. Now,
			once you have made NetBeans type the first occurrence of the word &quot;invoice&quot;
			remember to use the word matching feature (Alt+K) explained in &quot;Tip 1&quot; to
			retype the identifier.
		</p>

		<p>
			Creating the macro is done by following these
			five steps:
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Select the menu &quot;Tools &gt; Options&quot;</li>
			<li>Expand &quot;Editing&quot; and &quot;Editor Settings&quot;</li>
			<li>Select &quot;Java Editor&quot;</li>
			<li>
				Look at the right half of the window for
				the property called &quot;Macros&quot; and click the &quot;...&quot; button to the far right.
			</li>
			<li>
				Add a new macro named &quot;Type identifier
				name using previous word&quot; containing the following macro code (simply copy
				it from here):
<pre class="examplecode">
selection-previous-word copy-to-clipboard
caret-next-word &quot; &quot; paste-from-clipboard caret-previous-word
selection-forward to-lower-case caret-next-word
</pre>
			</li>
		</ol>


		<p>
			Finally click the OK button of the &quot;Macros&quot;
			window to close it but keep the &quot;Options&quot; window open - you need it in
			order to create a shortcut key combination for your new macro:
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>
				Open the &quot;Key Bindings&quot; window by
				clicking the &quot;...&quot; button of the property named &quot;Key Bindings&quot;
			</li>
			<li>Click &quot;Sort by Name&quot; and select your new
			 macro which will listed under the name &quot;macro-Type identifier name using
			 previous word&quot;</li>
			<li>Add the &quot;Alt+N&quot; shortcut by clicking the
			 &quot;Add&quot; button.</li>
		</ol>

		<p>
			When creating macros you would normally use the
			macro recording feature which let you record mouse and keyboard gestures and
			save them as a macro. However, the macro shown here contains the
			&quot;to-lower-case&quot; action and this action is not yet represented by a mouse or
			keyboard gesture, so you need to add this action manually.
		</p>

		<h3>Tip 3: Create an Assignment Macro</h3>

		<p>
			This is one of my favourite macros! Usually
			when you define a constructor you need to assign the value of the constructor
			parameters to class variables as in this example:
		</p>

<pre class="examplecode">
public Person(String name, String emailAddress) {
	this.name = name;
	this.emailAddress = emailAddress;
}
</pre>

		<p>
			If you define the following macro and bind
			it to Alt+=, instead of typing &quot;this.emailAddress = emailAddress;&quot; you� can
			simply type &quot;this.e&quot; followed by Ctrl+K to get &quot;this.emailAddress&quot; followed by
			Alt+= which will type the rest.
		</p>

		<p>
			See &quot;Tip 2&quot; for instructions on how to create
			the macro. Here is the macro code:
		</p>

<pre class="examplecode">
selection-previous-word copy-to-clipboard caret-next-word &quot; = &quot; paste-from-clipboard &quot;;&quot;
</pre>

		<p>
			Once you get into the habit of using the
			Alt+= macro you will find it to be way faster than anything else.
		</p>

		<h3>Tip 4: Use Abbreviations</h3>

		<p>
			NetBeans has a long range of built in
			abbreviations for typing well-known words or even multi-line code constructs.
			You can try this out by typing &quot;sout&quot; followed by pressing the Space bar � this
			will make NetBeans type a complete standard output statement for you, i.e.
		</p>

<pre class="examplecode">
System.out.println(&quot;|&quot;);
</pre>

		<p>
			<img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/abbreviations.png" class="align-right" vspace="5" hspace="20"/>
			NetBeans does not type a &quot;|&quot; character as
			shown, rather the IDE places your cursor at that location after the
			abbreviation has been replaced.
		</p>

		<p>
			The built in abbreviations are a real time saver,
			but you can benefit even more from the abbreviations feature by defining your
			own custom abbreviations.
		</p>

		<p>
			A good way to start is by looking through your
			existing code files and locating code constructs which you use frequently. A
			typical example of a frequently used construct could be the if/throw
			construct found in this method:
		</p>

<pre class="examplecode">
public void remove(int lower, int upper) {
	if(lower < 0)
		throw new IllegalArgumentException(
			&quot;Parameter \&quot;lower\&quot; has to be a &quot; +
			&quot;non-negative number.&quot;
		);
}
</pre>

		<p>
			This method starts with a guardian
			statement which asserts that the first parameter is a legal argument � if not,
			an IllegalArgumentException is thrown.
		</p>

		<p>
			Since placing such guardian statement is good,
			common practice, you can benefit from adding an abbreviation which NetBeans
			will expand to the if/throw construct. This can be done as follows:
		</p>

		<ol>
			<li>Select the menu &quot;Tools &gt; Options&quot;</li>
			<li>Expand the nodes &quot;Editing&quot;, &quot;Editor Settings&quot;,
			 and &quot;Java Editor&quot;</li>
			<li>Click the &quot;...&quot; button of the row
			 containing the property &quot;Abbreviations&quot;</li>
			<li>
				Add an abbreviation called &quot;ill&quot; which expands to
<pre class="examplecode">
if(|)
	throw new IllegalArgumentException(&quot;&quot;);
</pre>
			</li>
		</ol>


		<p>
			Note that NetBeans understands the use of
			the &quot;|&quot; character to indicate where the cursor should be placed after the
			expansion.
		</p>

		<p>
			Now try typing &quot;ill&quot; and pressing Space - voila!
		</p>

		<p>
			Of course you could create a macro which
			types exactly the same thing, but an important benefit of abbreviations is the
			fact that they are easy to remember because you can give them mnemonic names
			like &quot;ill&quot; or even &quot;illarg&quot; instead of cryptic keyboard combinations like
			&quot;Ctrl+Alt+I&quot;. The downside to abbreviations is they cannot trigger a macro � at
			least not yet...
		</p>

		<h3>Tip 5: Use Source Templates</h3>

		<p>
			The really easy-to-use template feature of
			NetBeans is completely overlooked by many developers. If you need to create
			many source files which have many aspects in common you should define a
			template containing these common aspects.
		</p>

		<p>
			For instance, in many systems you have
			rules for how an exception class should be defined or rules which say that all
			classes extending class X should contain certain methods, variables,
			documentation or the like.
		</p>

		<p>
			When writing a new class, what many
			developers do is to start out from the empty &quot;Java Class&quot; template and write
			everything by hand; often this involves typing code which you have written
			before. Instead you should find a class which is a good starting point,
			right-click its tree node and select &quot;Save As Template...&quot;. Now, whenever you
			need to create a similar class you just right-click the package in which the
			new class should be placed, select the menu item &quot;New &gt; File/Folder...&quot; and
			choose the template.
		</p>

		<p>
			Defining a template from an existing source
			file might actually give you more content than needed, but once the template
			has been defined you can customize it to remove any unnecessary code by
			selecting the menu item &quot;Tools &gt; Options&quot; and locating the template under
			&quot;Source Creation and Managent&quot;. You simply right-click its tree node and select
			&quot;Edit&quot;, edit the file, and save it.
		</p>

		<p>
			If you provide an API to your co-workers in
			which they need to implement the same interface quite often, you could help them
			by providing a source template along with your API. Sharing a template is as
			simple as copying it from one machine to the next. The templates are stored in
			the folder
		</p>

		<p>
			&quot;... [user home dir]\.netbeans\4.0\config\Templates\[your template folder]&quot;
		</p>

		<p>
			If you use versioning, I warmly recommend
			creating a set of project templates and sharing them through your versioning
			system.
		</p>

		<h3>Tip 6: Edit Getters and Setters Efficiently</h3>

		<p>
			If you write Java beans by hand a huge
			amount of time might be wasted on writing and maintaining the trivial getter and setter
			methods. Fortunately, NetBeans can both generate these methods for you, and the
			IDE even has a built in mechanism for maintaining them efficiently. Since
			NetBeans 4.0 the refactoring mechanism has supported generating default getter
			and setter methods from a class&apos; variables. To create the getName and setName
			methods shown here
		</p>

<pre class="examplecode">
public class Customer {
  private String name;

    public String getName() {
      return name;
    }

    public void setName(String name) {
      this.name = name;
    }
}
		</pre>

		<p>
			all you have to do is to declare the name
			property, right-click it, and select the popup menu item &quot;Refactor... &gt;
			Encapsulate Fields...&quot;.
		</p>

		<p>
			<img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/bean-patterns.png" class="align-right" vspace="5" hspace="20"/>
			Once the methods have been generated, you
			might want to change the name of the property "name". This could potentially
			involve quite a lot of typing, since the word &quot;name&quot; or &quot;Name&quot; is now scattered
			all over your source file. Luckily, NetBeans has a really nice feature called
			&quot;Bean Patterns&quot; which solves this problem. If you locate your class in the
			Project tree and expand its tree node, NetBeans displays a node called &quot;Bean
			Patterns&quot; which contains a subnode for each bean property of the class. This
			node can be renamed by hitting either F2 or by right-clicking and selecting &quot;Rename...&quot;,
			and if you rename your property this way, NetBeans will make all the necessary
			changes for you.
		</p>

		<p>
			The Bean Patterns feature also allows you to change the
			property&apos;s type efficiently. If you right-click the property&apos;s tree node and
			select the popup menu item &quot;Properties&quot;, this opens a window containing
			information about the property. Here you can change the type and NetBeans will
			alter your source code accordingly.
		</p>

		<h3>Tip 7: Use the &quot;Fix Imports&quot; Tool</h3>

		<p>
			In brief: You should never write import
			statements. NetBeans 4.0 has introduced a really brilliant feature called &quot;Fix
			Imports&quot; accessible by the keyboard combination Alt+Shift+F. This feature analyses
			your source code and looks for class names which are not yet imported. If a
			class X has not been imported yet and only one class in your whole project is
			called X, NetBeans will import this class automatically. If two classes in two
			different packages are named X, NetBeans will bring up a dialog asking which
			class you prefer to import. &quot;Fix Imports&quot; works extremely well, and
			it automatically removes imports which are no longer used.
		</p>

		<h2>Conclusion</h2>

		<p>
			By using these tips you will soon find yourself producing
			better code with less syntactical errors in less time. Also, if you
			are among the many developers who have experienced aching fingers in
			coding intensive projects, making NetBeans write the code for you
			is definitely the way to go.
		</p>
		<p>
			The more you customize the IDE to fit your project's specific needs
			the faster you can implement your system. NetBeans 4.0 is like the
			perfect racing car - fast and fun to ride. But just
			like the racing car, tuning it is essential. Tune the IDE by
			customizing the abbreviations, macros, and templates to
			fit your project's specific needs and unleash the true
			power of NetBeans 4.0!
