<h1>NetBeans IDE 4.0 Profiler Tutorial</h1>
<div class="articledate" style="margin-left:0px;">Contributed by  Gregg Sporar as part of the <a href="../win-with-netbeans.html">Win With NetBeans</a> comptetition</div>
<p>This article is intended to be used in conjuction with NetBeans Profiler, Milestone 5. 

<p>The NetBeans Profiler is a powerful tool that provides important information about
the runtime behavior of your application.  While imposing relatively little overhead,
the NetBeans Profiler tracks CPU performance and memory usage.
This tutorial will show you how to use the Profiler with NetBeans 4.0 to:</p>

<ul>
  <li><a href="#runtime">Monitor the runtime behavior of a web application</a></li>
  <li><a href="#cpu">Determine the CPU time used by an application's methods</a></li>
  <li><a href="#createObjects">Monitor the creation of objects by an application.</a></li>
</ul>

<p>Portions of this tutorial originally appeared in a June, 2004 <i>Java Developer's Journal</i> article
(http://sys-con.com/story/?storyid=45081&DE=1) about JFluid,
the underlying technology used by the NetBeans Profiler.  All reprinted material is used

<p><a name="top"></a>This tutorial should take approximately one hour to complete.</p>

<h2><a name="genericsetup"></a>Setting Up Your Environment</h2></br><br />
<div class="indent">
<h3 class="tutorial">Installing the Profiler</h3>
<p>

The NetBeans Profiler is in beta and is available as a separate download.
To use this tutorial you must install the most recent version of the NetBeans
Profiler.  Be sure to follow the NetBeans Profiler <a href="http://profiler.netbeans.org/index.html">
Download & Install instructions</a>.
</p>
<h3 class="tutorial"><a name="tomcat"></a>Configuring Tomcat</h3>
<p>

Profiling a web application requires that the web server be run with
the JDK that is included with the NetBeans Profiler.  So to use
the Profiler with the Tomcat server that is bundled with NetBeans
a small change to the way Tomcat starts is necessary.  The easiest way to do this is to
 modify the script that
 starts Tomcat.  The script is catalina.bat (on Windows) or catalina.sh (on Unix).
 These scripts are located in Tomcat's bin folder; a typical location on
 a Windows system would be: <br>
  <pre class="examplecode">
  C:\Program Files\netbeans-4.0\nb4.0\jakarta-tomcat-5.0.28\bin\catalina.bat</pre>
  And on Unix the location will be something like:
  <pre class="examplecode">
  /export/home/gs/tools/netbeans/40/nb4.0/jakarta-tomcat-5.0.28/bin/catalina.sh</pre>
  <ol>
     <li>Save a copy of the script as a backup.</li>
     <p><li>Right below the large block of comments that is at the top of the file,
     add a line that sets <tt>JAVA_HOME</tt> to the folder that contains the JDK included
     with the NetBeans Profiler.  Choose Profiler > Help > About Profiler in NetBeans
     to display the folder name.  Example value on Windows:
     <pre class="examplecode">
    set JAVA_HOME=c:\Documents and Settings\gs\.netbeans\4.0\modules\profiler-ea-vm\</pre>
     Example value on Unix:
     <pre class="examplecode">
    JAVA_HOME="/home/gs/.netbeans/4.0/modules/profiler-ea-vm/"
</pre></li>
  </ol>
</p>
<h3 class="tutorial">Obtaining the required source files</h3>
<p>
This tutorial uses a web application based on the
HelloWeb project created in the
<a href="../../kb/archive/index.html">
NetBeans IDE 4.0 Quick Start Guide for Web Applications</a>.  The modifications
for this tutorial include the addition of a servlet that handles the
incoming request.  It creates a Java bean and then dispatches to the JSP
that creates the response.  The servlet has been poorly written on purpose in order
to highlight features of the NetBeans Profiler.

<p>You get all application files from the <tt>ProfilingTutorial.zip</tt> file.</p>
<ol>
  <li>In your file system, create a folder for the unzipped application files. From now on,
  this folder will be referred to as <tt><i>&#36;</i><i>UNZIPHOME</i></tt>.</li>
  <p><li>Click <tt><a href="https://netbeans.org/files/documents/4/387/ProfilingTutorial.zip">here</a></tt>
  to download the <tt>ProfilingTutorial.zip</tt> file.</li><p></p>
  <p><li>Use an application that unzips files to unzip the <tt>ProfilingTutorial.zip</tt>
  file to <tt><i>&#36;</i><i>UNZIPHOME</i></tt>.</li><p></p>
  <p><tt><i>&#36;</i><i>UNZIPHOME</i></tt> now has <tt>web</tt> and <tt>src</tt> folders. The
  <tt>web</tt> folder contains the two JSP files and the deployment descriptors.  The
  <tt>src</tt> folder contains the source files for the servlet and Java bean classes.</p>
</ol>
</div>

<h2><a name="create"></a>Creating a Project</h2></br><br />
<div class="indent">
<h3 class="tutorial">Creating a web project from the
 provided source files</h3>
 <ol>
  <li>Choose File &gt; New Project (Ctrl-Shift-N). Under Categories, select Web.
  Under Projects, select Web Project with Existing Sources. Click Next.</li><p>
  <li>In Location, click Browse to select the web application's document root. The
  document root is <tt><i>&#36;</i><i>UNZIPHOME</i></tt>, the folder to which you
  unzipped the <tt>ProfilingTutorial.zip</tt> file.</li><p>
  <li>In Project Name, type <tt>ProfilingTutorial</tt>. Click Next.</li><p>
  <li>Click Finish. The IDE creates the <tt><i>&#36;</i><i>UNZIPHOME/nbproject</i></tt>
  project folder and the <tt><i>&#36;</i><i>UNZIPHOME/build.xml</i></tt> file.
  The ProfilingTutorial project opens in the
  IDE. You can view its logical structure in the Projects window and its file
  structure in the Files window.</li><p>
  <li>This final step is only required when NetBeans is configured to use JDK v5 as
  the default Java Platform. <p>
    <ol type="i">
    <li>The current Profiler only supports .class files created by
  JDK v1.4.2, so if you have not installed a v1.4.2 JDK and configured it as a NetBeans
  Java Platform, you will need to do so. Note that in its beta release the NetBeans Profiler installs
  a JDK based on v1.4.2 - you set it as <tt>JAVA_HOME</tt> up in the <a href="#tomcat">
     Configuring Tomcat</a> step.  For more information refer to the online <a href="http://profiler.netbeans.org/docs/help/index.html">
  Profiler help</a>.<p>
    <li>In the Projects window right-click the <tt>ProfilingTutorial</tt>
  entry and choose Properties.  Select a Java Platform that uses the v.1.4.2 JDK and then
  click the OK button.  </li><p>
     <li>In the Tomcat bin folder, make a backup copy of catalina.50.bat (on
     Windows) or catalina.50.sh (on Unix).</li><p>
     <li>Make the same edit to catalina.50.bat (on Windows) or catalina.50.sh (on Unix) that
     you made in the <a href="#tomcat">
     Configuring Tomcat</a> step.</li><p>
     </ol>
</li>
  </ol>
  </div>
<h3 class="tutorial">Running the Project</h3>

<ol>
<li>In the Projects window right-click the <tt>ProfilingTutorial</tt> entry and choose
Clean and Build Project.  Then right-click the <tt>ProfilingTutorial</tt> entry again
and choose Run Project.  This will cause the IDE to build the project, start Tomcat, and then
display the index.jsp page in a browser window.</li><p>
<li>Verify that Tomcat started correctly by clicking the Bundled Tomcat
tab in the IDE's Output window.  Scroll to the top of the Tomcat output to verify
that Tomcat was started with the NetBeans Profiler JVM.  Examine the line
that begins with <tt>Using JAVA_HOME</tt>; the Java home should be the folder
that contains the NetBeans Profiler JVM.  If Tomcat does not start or the <tt>JAVA_HOME</tt>
is not the directory that contains the NetBeans Profiler JVM, then verify that you
followed the instructions in the <a href="#tomcat">Configuring Tomcat</a> step.
Sample output for Windows is illustrated below.

<p><a href="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/tomcat.png" title="View Tomcat output - click for full size image"><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/tomcat-small.png" width="500" height="121" alt="View Tomcat output - click for full size image" vspace="5" hspace="5" class="b-none" style="display: block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"></a></li>

<p><li>A browser window should have opened and displayed the
<tt>http://localhost:8084/ProfilingTutorial/</tt> page.  Verify that the web application is working by
typing <tt>NetBeans User</tt> into
the name field and clicking the OK button.  The result should be similar to the
illustration below.
<img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/hello.png" class="align-center" alt="View Application Output" vspace="5" style="display: block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"></li><p>
</ol>
</div>

<h2><a name="runtime"></a>Monitoring Runtime Behavior</h2></br><br />
<div class="indent">
<h3 class="tutorial">Attaching to a Running Application</h3>
 <p>
 Now that you have verified that Tomcat is using the JVM included with the NetBeans
 Profiler you can attach the IDE's profiling tools to that JVM and monitor its runtime
 behavior.
  <ol>
 <li>Choose Profile &gt; Attach Profiler.  The Specify Attach Settings dialog is
 displayed.</li>
 <p><li>For Attach To: choose J2EE Web/App Server</li>
 <p><li>For Running on: click the This Computer radio button</li>
 <p><li>For Attach Settings click the Dynamic Attachment radion button and then click
 the Select Running VM radio button.  Select
 the Tomcat entry (typically <tt>org.apache.catalina.startup.Bootstrap start</tt>) from the list of
 VMs.</li>
 <p><li>In Working Directory type the fully
 qualified name of Tomcat's bin folder.  As an example, a typical value on
 a Windows system would be: <br>
  <pre class="examplecode">
  C:\Program Files\netbeans-4.0\nb4.0\jakarta-tomcat-5.0.28\bin</pre>
  And on Unix the value will be something like:
  <pre class="examplecode">
  /export/home/gs/tools/netbeans/40/nb4.0/jakarta-tomcat-5.0.28/bin</pre>
  </li>
  <p><li>Click the OK button. The Attach and Profile dialog is displayed.</li>
  <p><li>Click the large Monitor Application button.
  Make sure that the Enable Threads
  Monitoring option is <i>not</i> checked.  </li><p>
  <li>Click the Attach button.</li>
 </ol>

 <h3 class="tutorial"><a name="interpretingMonitor">Interpreting the Monitor Graphs</a></h3>
 The NetBeans Profiler displays three graphs in the output window, as illustrated below.

<p><a href="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/monitorGraphs.png" title="View Monitor Graphs - click for full size image"><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/monitorGraphs-small.png" width="500" height="110" class="align-center" alt="View Monitor Graphs - click for full size image" vspace="5" hspace="5" class="b-none" style="display: block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"></a>

 <p>The graph on the left is the easiest to understand.  The red shading indicates the allocated
 size of the JVM heap, updated approximately once per second.  The purple
 overlay indicates the amount of heap space actually in  use.  In the example above the
 allocated heap size at the last update was almost 14 megabytes.  Of that 14 megabytes
 a little over 4 megabytes is actually being used to hold Java objects.</p>
 <p>The graph on the right is also easy to understand.  It merely shows the count of active
 threads in the JVM, updated approximately once per second.</p>
 <p>The graph in the center is the most interesting.  It shows two important heap
 statistics.
 <ul>
 <li>The blue line is the percentage of execution time spent by
 the JVM doing garbage collection and is graphed against the y-axis on the right
 edge of the graph. Time spent by the JVM doing garbage collection is time that is
 not available for it to run your application.  So if the blue line indicates a large
 percentage you may want to consider tuning the JVM by configuring a larger heap
 size (refer to the -Xmx parameter
 <a href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/">documentation</a>)
 or perhaps switching to a different garbage collection
 <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/hotspot/gc1.4.2/">algorithm</a>.</li><p>
<li>
 The red line is surviving generations and is graphed against the y-axis scale
 on the left edge of the graph.  The count of surviving generations is the number of different
 ages of all the Java objects on the JVM's heap, where "age" is defined as the number of
 garbage collections that an object has survived.  When the value for surviving generations is low it
 indicates that most of the objects on the heap have been around about the same amount of time.
 If, however, the value for surviving generations is increasing at a high rate over time then it
 indicates your application is allocating new objects while maintaining references to many
 of the older objects it already allocated.  If those older objects are in fact no longer
 needed then your application is wasting (or "leaking") memory.
 </li>
 </ul>
 Clicking the <img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/telemetryGraphsButton.png" alt="View Telemetry Graphs Button" > button will
 cause the IDE to display  larger versions of the three graphs in the main display window.<p>
</div>

<h2><a name="cpu"></a>Determining CPU Time Used by a Method</h2></br><br />
<div class="indent">
<h3 class="tutorial">Switching to Performance Analysis Mode</h3>
<p>

 The Profiler is attached to the Tomcat JVM, but is only monitoring high level statistics.  To
 find out detailed information about the performance of a specific method (or methods) in
 the application you will need to modify the Profiler's settings.
 <ol>
 <li>Click the <img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/modifyProfilingButton.png" alt="View Modify Profiling Button" > button or
 choose Profile &gt; Modify Profiling.<p></li>
 <li>Click the Analyze Performance button.<p></li>
 <li>Select the Part of Application radio button.  Then click the
 Select button that is next to the Part of Application radio button.<p></li>
 <li>Click the Add button.<p></li>
 <li>Click the Select button.  The Profiler displays the Select Class tree.<p></li>
 <li>Expand the ProfilingTutorial entry by clicking its plus sign icon.<p></li>
 <li>Expand the Source Packages entry by clicking its plus sign icon.<p></li>
 <li>Expand the org.me.hello entry.<p></li>
 <li>Expand the RequestHandler.java entry.<p></li>
 <li>Click the RequestHandler entry and then click the OK button.<p></li>
 <li>The methods in the RequestHandler class are now displayed in the Select Methods dialog
 as illustrated below.  Click the <tt>processRequest</tt> method and then click the OK button.

<p><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/selectMethods.png" alt="View Select Methods Dialog" vspace=5 style="display: block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"></li>

<p><li>Select the <tt>processRequest</tt> method by clicking on it in the list of
 Root Methods and then click the OK button.
 You have just selected <tt>processRequest</tt> as the root method for performance analysis.  This means
 that the <tt>processRequest</tt> method and all methods that it calls, and all methods that they
 in turn call (and so on) will be monitored.  Starting
 from <tt>processRequest</tt>, the
 Profiler does analysis of the method call graph to determine which methods need profiling.
 Only those methods are profiled - the rest of your application will continue to run at full
 speed with no profiling overhead.<p></li>
 <li>Click the OK button on the Modify Profiling dialog.<p></li>
 </ol>
<h3 class="tutorial">Running the Profiled Method</h3>
<p>

 Now that you have chosen <tt>processRequest</tt> as a root method you need to use the
 portion of the web application that causes that root method to run.  This is easy to do
 because the <tt>processRequest</tt> method handles all requests from the index.jsp page.
 <ol>
 <li>In your web browser click the Back button to return to the
 <tt>http://localhost:8084/ProfilingTutorial/</tt> page.<p></li>
 <li>Click the OK button to resubmit "NetBeans User" as your user name.  It will take a bit
 longer before the response appears because the Profiler is monitoring performance of the
 <tt>processRequest</tt> method.
 <li>After <b>Hello, NetBeans User!</b> displays in your browser, click the
 <img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/currentResultsButton.png" alt="View CurrentResults Button"> button or
 choose Profile &gt; Get Current Results.
 </ol>


 <h3 class="tutorial">Interpreting the Performance Analysis Graphs</h3>
  <p>



 The Profiler displays the latest performance results, as illustrated below.

 <p><a href="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/performanceResults.png" title="View Performance Results - click for full size image"><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/performanceResults-small.png" width="500" height="352" class="align-center" alt="View Performance Results - click for full size image" class="b-none" style="display: block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"></a>

 <p>The top window shows the complete method call graph beginning with the root method.
 The <tt>processRequest</tt> method ran for 168 milliseconds (ms).  Note, however, that very
 little time was spent running the instructions of the <tt>processRequest</tt> method itself -
 the sixth line in the window shows the "self time" for <tt>processRequest</tt> to be only 0.421 ms.
 The vast majority of the time was spent in methods called by <tt>processRequest</tt>.  In particular,
 the <tt>forward</tt> method took up 84.7% of the execution time.  This is not surprising
 given the amount of work the <tt>forward</tt> method has been given to do.</p>
 <p>The power of the NetBeans Profiler is it helps you identify bottlenecks in your code
 that were not expected or that will prevent your application from scaling well.
 Note that the <tt>createUniqueID</tt> method took up 11.3% of the execution time. You can
 click the plus sign next to the <tt>createUniqueID</tt> entry to investigate exactly where
 the time went.  If you
 examine the source code for <tt>createUniqueID</tt> you will discover it uses a hideously
 inefficient algorithm that should be redesigned.
 <p>The bottom window is a flatter depiction - it shows the "self time" for each
 method in the call graph.</p>

<br />

<h2><a name="createObjects"></a>Monitoring the Creation of Objects
</h2></br><br />
<div class="indent">
<h3 class="tutorial">Switching to Memory Analysis Mode</h3>
<p>

 The Profiler can do detailed analysis (also referred to as <i>instrumentation</i>) of CPU performance or memory
 usage, but it cannot do both at the same time.  To
 find out detailed information about the allocation and garbage collection of
 objects on the JVM's heap you will need to modify the Profiler's settings.
 <ol>
 <li>Click the <img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/modifyProfilingButton.png" alt="View Modify Profiling Button" > button
 or choose Profile &gt; Modify Profiling.<p></li>
 <li>Click the Analyze Memory Usage button.<p></li>
 <li>Select the Record both object creation and garbage collection radio button.<p></li>
 <li>Click the OK button.<p></li>
 </ol>

 <h3 class="tutorial">Running the Profiled Application</h3>
 <p>

 Now that you have chosen analyze memory usage you need to use the
 web application in order to determine whether it is using memory efficiently.
 <ol>
 <li>In your web browser click the Back button to return to the
 <tt>http://localhost:8084/ProfilingTutorial/</tt> page.<p></li>
 <li>Click the OK button to resubmit "NetBeans User" as your user name.<p></li>
 <li>After <b>Hello, NetBeans User!</b> displays in your browser, click the browser's Back button
     to return to the previous page.<p></li>
 <li>Repeat steps 2 through 3 nine times.  Repeated submission of the same user name is
 necessary for this demonstration.<p></li>
 <li>Click the
 <img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/currentResultsButton.png" alt="View CurrentResults Button"> button  or
 choose Profile &gt; Get Current Results.<p></li>
 <li>The Profiler displays the latest memory analysis results in a table.  Click
 the Class Name column to sort the rows by class name.<p></li>
 <li>Scroll down through the table rows until the row for the
 <tt>org.me.hello.NameHandler</tt> class is displayed.<p></li>
 </ol>

 <h3 class="tutorial">Interpreting the Memory Analysis Graphs</h3>
<p>
 The illustration below shows the statistics for the <tt>org.me.hello.NameHandler</tt> class.

<p><a href="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/liveObjects.png" title="View Memory Results - click for full size image"><img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/liveObjects-small.png" class="align-center" width="500" height="273" alt="View Memory Results - click for full size image" vspace=5 class="b-none" style="display: block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;"></a>

 <p>The columns provide object allocation and memory usage information.
 <ul>
 <li>Total alloc. obj. (on the far right) is easiest to understand.  This is the total count
 of all objects of this class that have been created. For the <tt>NameHandler</tt> class this value is
 10, which is the number of times you pressed the Ok button on the web application's form.<p></li>
 <li>Allocated Objects is the number of objects that the Profiler is actually monitoring.
 In this example, of the 10 instances of <tt>NameHandler</tt> that have been created
 the Profiler is only monitoring 1 of those instances.
 By default
 this number will be approximately ten percent of the value of total allocated objects (so the
 numbers you see might vary a bit from the illustration).  By monitoring
 only a subset of the created objects the Profiler is able to dramatically reduce the overhead
 it places on the JVM, which then allows your application to run at close to full speed.<p></li>
 <li>Live Objects is the number of the Allocated Objects that are still on the JVM's heap and
 are therefore taking up memory.<p></li>
 <li>The two Live Bytes columns show the amount of heap memory being used by the Live Objects.
 One column displays a graph, the other displays text.<p></li>
 <li>The Age Average value is calculated using the Live Objects.  The age of each object is the number
 of garbage collections that it has survived.  The sum of the ages divided by the number
 of Live Objects is the Age Average.<p></li>
 <li>The Generations value is calculated using the Live Objects.  As with Age Average, the
 age of an object is the number of garbage collections it has survived.  The Generations value
 is the number of different ages for the Live Objects.<p></li>
 </ul>
 <p>You can use this information to help track down memory leaks.  The value for Generations
 is the same as the Surviving Generations value described in the <a href="#interpretingMonitor">Interpreting the
 Monitor Graphs</a> section, but restricted to the objects of a single class.  This finer granularity
 of monitoring can help you find the specific objects that are wasting heap space.  </p>

 <p>In this example,
 though, you do not even need Generations to see a problem with the <tt>NameHandler</tt> class.  The Total
 alloc. obj. value is 10.  The intent of the servlet code was to reuse <tt>NameHandler</tt> objects
 when the same user name is entered.  Clearly, that is not happening.  The bug is in the
 <tt>processRequest</tt> method: the key used to check for an entry in the <tt>Map</tt> is not
 the same as the key used to store the entry.  The result is a pretty typical Java memory
 leak: an object is placed into a <tt>Map</tt> and then forgotten.</p>

 <p>Another handy tool for understanding application behavior is to see where in your code
 the objects of a particular class are being allocated.  This can often provide clues about
 why an object is still on the heap. The NetBeans Profiler will display stack traces for any
 class if you right-click the class's entry in the table and choose Show Allocations Stack Traces.
 </p>
 <p>To end the profiling session, choose Profile &gt; Detach.</p>
