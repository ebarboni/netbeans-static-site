<h1>Using BEA WebLogic JRockit<sup>TM</sup> with NetBeans 4.0</h1>

<p></p>
<p>A heavy user of the NetBeans IDE will experience from time to time that a classpath 
scanning takes more time than expected. Also he might experience that NetBeans can be 
resource consuming, especially on older machines. Hence it might be a good idea 
to search for methods to speed up the IDE. But how can this be done? Well one 
possibility is described here in terms of using a different JVM. 
</p><p>
The main advantages for using JRockit is that it is optimized for performance on
Intel plattforms and it ships with profiling and managing products like the console which
will be described here and the JRockit Runtime Analyzer. 
</p>
<p>This article describes how to use the BEA WebLogic JRockit JVM ("JRockit") as
a runtime environment for the NetBeans IDE.
</p>

<p>JRockit can be freely downloaded and used for production or development purposes if you
agree to the End-User License Agreement which can be accessed

<p>

<b>Why do we need another JVM?</b><br>
Well this question is not easy to answer because definitely not every body needs it. So
to make a first cut: Only developers of Java applications and Java based web applications
might want to read this article and might be interested. But also Administrators and
Operators of highavailable Websites might find something here. 
</p><p>
If you've ever tried to use the profiling of the JVM or wanted to have a deeper look into
what is going on in your virtual machine while your program is allready running, you might
run into the problem that the information provided by the VM is very low level. You will
have a hard time to go into the depths of analysing the data that is produced by the VM.
(For instance if you switch on the -Xprof parameter of the JVM 1.4.x or the -agentlib:hprof 
of the JVM 5.0)
</p><p>
And some information might not be available any way, even if you use the profiling. One
solution to that problem could be, that you write your own profiling agent. Java gives you
access to deep VM information through the <i>Java Virtual Machine Profiler Interface</i>
(JVMPI). But that means that you'll have to implement your own profiling in a native way. There is - as
far as I know - no standard java way to access lowlevel profiling informations.
</p><p>
If you use JRockit you'll not have to worry about this. There is the so called "Console" that
ships with JRockit and gives you direct access to vital informations of the applications that
run in your JVM. Even to the point that it estimates execution times of single methods, gives you
an overview of the most used classes and counts exceptions thrown.
</p><p>
<b>Is it for debugging only?</b><br>
That's a definite "NO". JRockit has been designed and optimized for intel platforms to achieve
best performance and reliability. It serves as JVM for the BEA WebLogic Server.
</p><p>

I don't want this to be another product presentation of BEA, so I suggest, if you are 
interested in JRockit and/or the WebLogic Server details, please follow 
<a href="http://www.bea.com/framework.jsp?CNT=index.htm&FP=/content/products/server">this</a>
link. 
</p><p>
<b>How do I exploit it?</b><br>
There are basically two ways. Once you've installed the JRockit JDK you can develop and 
execute Java Applications with out even noticing, that you are using a different JVM except
that you might notice a considerable performance boost to some of your applications. It is 
to be mentioned that if you program nonsense, there is no way that your program executes
any faster than before. So we are not talking about magic! ;-)
</p><p>
<ol>
<li>The first major advantage you might want to exploit is that the JRockit Console gives you
access to fine granular information collected somewhere in the depths of the JVM. You'll understand
how to use and instrumentalize the Console for your application in a later chapter. 
</li>
<li>The second advantage is that you'll use the JRockit Runtime Analyzer (JRA) to collect information
during runtime. If you are using JRockit in a production environment, this tool can give you 
access to the necessary information during runtime without restarting the application. Specifically
in a web environment where it is impossible just to restart an instrumentalized version of the
server that becomes very important.
</li>
</ol>

<h3 class='tutorial'>Download<a name="download"></a></h3>

<p>To download the JRockit environment you'll have to access the website of BEA Systems, Inc.
<a href="http://www.bea.com" target="_blank">http://www.bea.com</a> or you just click
<a href="http://commerce.bea.com/products/weblogicjrockit/other_versions.jsp" target="_blank">here</a>
to access the download area directly.
</p><p>
The JRA must be downloaded separately via 
<a href="http://www.bea.com/framework.jsp?CNT=index.htm&FP=/content/products/weblogic/jrockit/">http://www.bea.com/framework.jsp</a>
</p><p>
The documentation for the JRA and JRockit itself are also interesting, available through the link
<a href="http://edocs.bea.com/jrockit/webdocs/index.html" target="_blank">http://edocs.bea.com/jrockit/webdocs/index.html</a>
</p><p>
<h3 class='tutorial'>Installation</h3>

After the download you'll need to install your JRE and/or the JDK. 
<p>
<img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/jr_inst.jpg" class="b-none">
</p>
After that a call to <code>java -version</code> should give you something like this:
<pre class='examplecode'>java version "1.5.0"
Java(TM) 2 Runtime Environment, Standard Edition (build 1.5.0-b64)
BEA WebLogic JRockit(R) (build dra-38972-20041208-2001-win-ia32, R25.0.0-75, GC: System 
optimized over throughput (initial strategy singleparpar))
</pre>
Nothing more is to do. 
</p><p>
If you are using different JDK's from different vendors at the same time I suggest to create batch
files that switch the used JDK to the appropriate one. 
</p>
</div>
<h2>Running NetBeans with JRockit<a name="running"></a></h2><br/>
<div class='indent'>
<h3 class='tutorial'>Configuration<a name="configuration"></a></h3>

Entry point for the configuration is the <code>etc/netbeans.conf</code>. You'll find it in your
NetBeans installation directory. In that file you'll have to change the lines:
<pre class='examplecode'>
# default location of J2SE JDK, can be overridden by using --jdkhome dir  switch
netbeans_jdkhome="C:\Programme\Java\jdk1.5.0"
</pre>
to
<pre class='examplecode'>
# default location of J2SE JDK, can be overridden by using --jdkhome dir switch
# netbeans_jdkhome="C:\Programme\Java\jdk1.5.0"
netbeans_jdkhome="C:\Programme\Java\jrockit-jdk1.5.0"
</pre>
You might need to adjust the paths to the proper installation directories of your JDK installation.
If you change it here, please be sure that you are <b>not</b> using the <code>--jdkhome</code> switch.

</p><p>
To provide access to the console, the JVM must be started with a commandline switch called <code>-Xmanagement</code>.
You can add this also in the <code>etc/netbeans.conf</code> file to the line
<pre class='examplecode'>netbeans_default_options="-J-Xms32m -J-Xmx250m -J-Xverify:none -J-Xmanagement"
</pre>
to start NetBeans itself with the management option. Then you are able to analyze NetBeans' JVM, Garbage Collector 
and see into the details of what has been programmed for the IDE ;-)
</p><p>
That's it. Now you are using JRockit as JVM for NetBeans - wasn't so hard, eh?
</p><p>
After restart of NetBeans you should find under Help->About in the details section a screen that looks
like this one:
</p><p>
<img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/nb_about.jpg" class="b-none">
</p><p>

Since the time stamp of the <code>src.zip</code> of JRockit can be different from your JDK installation, NetBeans
might need to scan that again. But this will only happen once.
<h3 class='tutorial'>Usage<a name="usage"></a></h3>
There is a certain amount of additional parameters that can be used to tweak JRockit. Here is a comprehensive
list, but please access

<h2>Advanced Usage<a name="advanced"></a></h2><br/>
<div class='indent'>
<h3 class='tutorial'>Console<a name="console"></a></h3>
The console is the vital part of the information retrieval. When you start it the first time, you'll see
nothing. Well too bad... You'll have to connect to a JRockit instance. The standard port of the connection
is 7091 which is by default also the management port for remote administration of the JVM. 
</p><p>
<b>Remark:</b> So if you start an application with JRockit in <code>-Xmanagement</code> mode, you'll be 
able to connect with Sun's jconsole Tool to the JVM and manage all Management Beans (MXBeans). Thats also
very handy. But consider, that the Sun jconsole is not the JRockit console: Two different tools!
</p><p>
So you create a new connection using the button or the menu "New Connection...". A dialog pops up where
you can enter the needed informations:

</p><p>
<img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/jr_connect.jpg" class="b-none">
</p><p>
As you can see, this works also remotely. So if you are on a management dedicated computer and you want to monitor
your Web Application Servers running on JRockit on a different server somewhere in the network, you can do 
so remotely unless no firewall restricts access to the ports.
</p><p>
If the connection could be established, the console is allready collecting data. And you'll see in the
Overview section an image like this:
</p><p>
<img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/jr_console.jpg" class="b-none">
</p><p>
Very interesting from a developers point of view, specifically for the developers of the NetBeans platform itself,
is the method profiler. It counts invocations of specific methods and collects execution times.
</p><p>
<img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/jr_methprof.jpg" class="b-none">
</p><p>
Profiling sessions are organized by named templates. In each template you can define specific objects to
observe. You just provide in the dialog that opens after you pushed the add button the full qualified 
class name of the class you would like to monitor and in a second step you'll be asked to select from a 
list the methods to be monitored. You have to consider that monitoring of abstract or native methods is 
not supported. After that hit the start button and wonder how fast the numbers increase. Then you'll know 
where the execution time goes to...
</p><p>
On the "Memory" tab of the JRockit console you are able to manage the memory that is currently used by 
the JRockit Process. It is possible to lock the heap size or you can resize the the heap during runtime.
That is also a nice feature if you are not able to restart your application at your will.
</p><p>

In the system tab you get some informations of the runtime environment of the JVM you are looking at. Very 
neat is the feature that you can tie Virtual Machine processes to specific Processors on a multi processor
plattform. If you have one...
</p><p>
Notifications might only be sensefull if you are monitoring a high available platform and you want to be 
notified automatically by the system if the heap size reaches a specific amount or the CPU load exceeds
90% or something like that. You can define listeners in this tab for such events and define what should be
done in such a case. Typically an email would be send out to an emergency administrator account. 
</p><p>
The last tab is the exception counter. If you provide an exception class name, all exceptions of this type 
thrown will be counted. This might be of interrest if you have well dedicated exceptions where you 
exactly know in which cases such an exception is thrown. Counting highlevel exceptions might scare you but 
you might not be able to extract some valuable information out of this.
</p><p>

</p><p>
<h3 class='tutorial'>JRockit Runtime Analyzer<a name="jra"></a></h3>
The runtime analyzer targets specifically people who are not able to restart a server for debugging or
runtime analysis. Specifically people like Administrators of 24/7 websites. Since this is not the target for
NetBeans developers, it is just briefly described here.
</p><p>
The tool is designed to collect data starting at a specific time and for a specified amount of time. Before
and after this, the JVM is running like if you where not collecting any data. So there is nothing to worry 
about loosing performance due to instrumentalization of the JVM. It is so deeply implemented that you'll be
unable to recognize any difference during runtime when runtime analysis is switched off.
</p><p>
The profiling will create an XML file on the machine that runs the JVM. The JRA tool then is designed to 
analyze offline the collected data. 
</p><p>
The collection process is started with a commandline tool called "JraRecordingStarter.jar" it needs some
arguments. A simple call could be:

<pre class='examplecode'>java -jar JraRecordingStarter.jar localhost 7091 myrecord.xml 300
</pre>
Where you provide the target host where the JVM is running, the management port, the name of the created
XML file and the recording time in seconds.
</p><p>
The created XML is zip'ed after it is completely flushed to disk. 
</p><p>
Then you are able to use the RuntimeAnalyzer to analyze the created results: 
</p><p>
<img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/jra_overview.jpg" class="b-none">
</p><p>
Also the executed garbage collections during the time of recording can be accessed and measured. Be aware
that my recording was very short in time and there was not much to collect. So in a real scenario you can
see much more information.
</p><p>

<h2>Issues<a name="issues"></a></h2>
<div class='indent'>
<p>There is a problem currently in the JRockit 5.0 Release. It appears as an error message in the NetBeans
Status field:
</p><p>
<img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/nb_error.jpg" class="b-none">
</p><p>
It has something to do with a final package local method being overridden in a different package. It is a bug
in JRockit with the current release. And it is supposed to be fixed in the next patch release. So you'll
have to wait or ignore. What ever fits you best ;-)
</p><p>
Unfortunately this error has impact on the NetBeans usage. You might not be able to access your java source
files in the project view pane. How ever you can access them through the file view instead. But that is 
really anoying. Good news: This error has been reported to BEA and they mentioned in the developer forum that
this error should be fixed with the next patch release.
</p><p>
So I suggest you wait until the next patch release of JRockit.
</p>
</div>
<h2>Finally</h2>
<div class='indent'>
<p>JRockit is a high performance JVM that works pretty good with NetBeans. I have been very supprised how
fast actually the classpath scanning can be finished. Also improved startup time of NetBeans is definitely a 
plus.
</p><p>
One might argue that there is not really a need for developers to switch the JVM but if you are a so called 
"early adopter" you should definitely give it a try. It's worth it specifically if you are using NetBeans 
on a daily basis.
