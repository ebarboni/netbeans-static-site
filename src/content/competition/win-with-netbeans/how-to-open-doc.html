<h1>Nice Tip: How to open any document type from NetBeans.</h1>
<div class="articledate" style="margin-left:0px;">Contributed by Vincent Brabant as part of the <a href="../../competition/win-with-netbeans.html">Win With NetBeans</a> comptetition</div></p><p>
How can I ask to NetBeans to open a .doc document with MS Word, a .XLS document with Excel, a .PPT document with Powerpoint, ...<br>
How can I ask to NetBeans to open the appropriate application when i click on a .LNK (often appears on our desktop).</p>

In fact, it's not so difficult.<br>
<br>
As you know, from NetBeans, we can open PDF file.<br>
<br>
The first time we will click on a PDF file, NetBeans will show us the following dialog box:<br>

<br>
<img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/PDF-Viewer-Not-Found.png" title="" alt="Dialog Box: PDF Viewer Not Found" style="width: 720px; height: 159px;"><br>
<br>
You have to select an executable. Logically we are selecting acrobat reader, of any other PDF viewer available on the market.<br>
But in fact, you are free to select any executable you want.<br>
<br>
And here is really the tip.<br>
<br>
Under windows 95, 98 and ME, it exists, under the command directory, an executable called Start.exe.<br>
That executable can receive a file as argument. Any kind of file. And
it will look which application is associated to that file's extension
and launch that application.<br>
<br>
<br>

Hereafter, how we can do.<br>
<br>
Click on select and go to your windows directory, then select the command directory and search about start.exe.<br>
<br>
<img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/Select-start-exe.png" title="" alt="choose the Start.exe file" style="width: 610px; height: 278px;"><br>
<br>
Choose it and click on Select. The current viewer is not anymore acroread, but the absolute name of start.exe.<br>
<br>
<img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/current-viewer.png" title="" alt="the current pdf viewer is the start.exe file" style="width: 720px; height: 159px;"><br>
<br>
Now, Acrobat Reader is well started and display the pdf file I selected.<br>
How it's possible ? Because start.exe received as parameter the PDF
filename and look which application is associated to that extention.<br>

Because I associated PDF with Acrobate Reader on my PC, system opens acrobat reader.<br>
<br>
Problem is that start.exe exists only under windows 95, 98 and ME. It doesn't exists under Windows NT, 2000 or XP.<br>
But the start command is well known under those systems. But implemented as a command processor extension.<br>
So, to solve the problem we have to do the following:<br>
1. creation of a .BAT file in C:\<br>
That BAT file will be called nbLauncher.bat.<br>
That bat file will contains the following:<br>
<font face="Courier New, Courier, mono">start %1<br>

2. select that bat file as current viewer.<br>
</font><br>
<br>
<br>
But how can I open other files, like .DOC, .XLS, EXE, or even .LNK files ?<br>
<br>
In the main menu, select Tools | Options.<br>
The Option Panel appears.<br>
Extends IDE Configuration | System | Object Types&nbsp; and select PDF Document Objects.<br>
On the properties panel, click on Extension and Mime Types three dots.<br>

<img src="../../images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/PDF-Properties-Panel.png" title="" alt="PDF Properties Panel" style="width: 858px; height: 533px;"><br>
<br>
By default, only PDF appears on the Item List, but feel you free to add
any extensions you want to be able to launch from NetBeans.<br>
For example, I added the doc, xls, lnk and exe suffixes<br>
<br>
<img src="https://netbeans.org/images_www/articles/win-with-netbeans/Extensions-and-mime-types.png" title="" alt="Extensions and mime types" style="width: 415px; height: 301px;"><br>
when finish, click on ok.<br>
<br>
and then click on close.<br>
<br>
Now, add a directory that contains somes documents or executables in
the Favorites windows. Also, add your desktop in the favorites windows.<br>
Now, you can click on every .LNK file, the corresponding application will be started.<br>

Click on a .DOC file and you document will appears in MS Word.<br>
<br>
Very Simple and realy very useful tips.<br>
<br>
Enjoy this tips.<br>
