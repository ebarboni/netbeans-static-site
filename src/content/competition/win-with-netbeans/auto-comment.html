<h1>The Cool Auto Comment Tool In NetBeans 4.0 - Now Documentation can be fun! </h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Sorry I had to make you laugh with the
title otherwise you would not read an article on writing
documentation.
<br>
I have always liked the JavaDoc tool in
the JDK Sun have released, it&rsquo;s a good way to point future
developers/Maintainers of your code in the right direction. Or if
you&rsquo;re like me, to point yourself in the right direction when
you have forgotten how your code works after a few months/weeks/days.</p>
<h2>What Can The Auto Comment Tool Do For Me?</h2>
<p>
Well it will not write your documentation for you. You still have to do that, however it will
format/structure your comments in a JavaDoc friendly way. 
<br>
Plus and this is key, <b>it will flag
up missing comments.</b> This is a more natural way to validate your
Java comments. Before I started using NetBeans or discovered the Auto
Comment tool, I would run the JavaDoc tool and change my comments or
parameters based on the warnings I received. This method is time
consuming / boring and means there was a higher chance I would get it
wrong. Using the Auto Comment tool you are alerted immediately to
errors or omissions and can correct the error then and there not
always having to flip back to code to correct.
</p>
<h2>How Do I Use The Auto Comment Tool?</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Open a Netbeans project
	<li>Open a Java file or select the
	Java file or class node in the Projects window. If you do not, the
	Auto Comment tool is not available. The Auto comment tools use is
	all based on context. If you run auto comment tool on another class
	it will not open another instance of auto comment. This means  you
	can only edit the comments for one Java file at a time. You can not
	run Auto Comment on a project as a whole (<i>Hint for a feature</i>)
	<li>From the menu <b>tools</b> select
	<b>Auto Comment&hellip;</b>

</ol>
<p>
Once the Auto Comment tool is open, in
the left pane you will see your list of methods in your class and a
series of buttons with icons in them. 
</p>
<p>
These buttons are filters. If you have
a class with a high number of methods and variables the Auto Comment
filters help you to focus on just what needs to be commented.</p>
<h2>Using Auto Comment Filters</h2>
<p>
Click on the first button to the left. This button will look like a green box with a white tick in it. It is
a toggle button. When this button is depressed all the comments that
meet the JavaDoc specification are displayed.
</p>
<p>
If you want a more detailed explanation
of the filter buttons. Go to the Help menu and click on Help
contents. Then click on the search tab and enter the keywords <b>Auto
Comment.  </b>Or simply click on the help button next to the list of
methods in the Auto Comment tool.
</p>
<p>
Note the icons displayed next to each
method in the list of your class below the filter buttons. </p>
<h2>Java Comment Is OK Icon</h2>
<p>
The icon that looks like a green box with a white tick in it is displayed means the comments for that
method or variable meet the JavaDoc specification and there is no
additional work for you to do. A<i>part from check you have entered a
relevant/accurate/up to date comment about the method or variable</i>.</p>

<h2>Missing Comments Icon</h2>
<p>
If you see an icon that looks like a red box with a white X in it, this means the methods comments do not
meet the JavaDoc specification or don't have any comments associated with it. 
When I first started using JavaDoc sometimes I would write my comment blocks like this...
</p>
<pre class='examplecode'>
/*
* Java rocks
*/</pre>
<p>
Of course nothing appeared in the Java docs because I missed an extra star. If you enter the comments via
Auto Comment in the <b>JavaDoc Comment text:</b> text field auto comment writes your comments to your code with the correct formatting
for example.</p>
<pre class='examplecode'>/**
* Java rocks

*/</pre>
<p>
If the error is <b>missing comment</b>. Auto Comment warns you in the list box below the list of methods. The
error message below that will be <b>JavaDoc comment is missing </b>.
If you have already commented the method or variable and its flagging
up this error you can check you have not missed that extra * by
clicking on the view source button. Again like everything in the Auto
Comment tool its all based on context. If you don't have a method
selected the view source button will be greyed out.
</p>
<h2>Partial Error Or You Got It Totally Wrong Icon</h2>
<p>
The icon we are most interested in is the partial error icon this looks like a triangle with a thunder bolt
through it. 
Most of the time you will see this error when you don't include a @param tag in your methods comments
that have parameters. Auto Comment will tell you which parameter has
the missing tag for example.
The tag for the parameter <b>&lt;Your parameter name&gt;</b> is missing.
</p>
<p>
Another example of when you will receive the partial error is when you add unnecessary tags to a
comment. For example if you add the author tag to a class method not
the class.  Look at the example below.
</p>
<pre class='examplecode'>

/**
 * This method does something
 * @param Something
 * @Author Jason Stapley &ndash; This is an error. Not me, the Author tag!
 */
Void doSomething(String Something) {
    System.out.println(Something);
}</pre>
<p>
You can correct this type of error in Auto Comment by selecting the unwanted tag in the tag list and
clicking on the delete button. Which leads nicely into the next
heading adding tags.
</p>
<h2>Adding Tags To Your Comment Blocks</h2>
<p>
Click on the <b>new... </b>button under
the tags list in the Auto Comment tool and you will see the new tag
window. This lists the types of tags you can add to your comment
block. The most common tags are @Param and
@Return after you select what type of tag you want, if its a
parameter you must name it in the parameter field. The parameter must
match the parameter in your method. Don't worry if you get it wrong
Auto Comment will flag it up. </p>
<p>Next add your comment in the <b>Description</b> field. Repeat until all your parameters and return
statement is commented. Click on another method or click on refresh.
The method you just commented should change to the Comment ok icon.
If not check the error message text box below the list of methods for
the reason why there is a problem.
</p>
<h2>Tag Order</h2>
<p>
You don't have to put your tags in any defined order for you JavaDoc to be correct. Its whatever is logical
to yourself, and to others who read your code. Using Auto Comment, you can change the
order of the tags in your comment block. For example if you want the
return tags to always be the last tag in the list you would select it
and move it to the bottom of the list by clicking on <b>Move Down
</b>button. If you want it at the top of the list you would select it
and click on the <b>Move Up </b>button again these buttons are only
available in the context of what you are doing.</p>
<h2> HTML Tags</h2>
<p>
Because JavaDoc creates HTML you can add HTML tags to your comments. Select a method or a field you want
to comment and in the <b>JavaDoc Comment Text</b>: field type &lt;
and wait a few seconds you should see a list of tags you can use Just
like when you are editing code you can type an object name and then
the dot and you see a list of methods this does the same for tags. 
You have the auto complete feature in tags <b>Description</b> field
as well. </p>
<p>There are also a selection of the most commonly used tags in JavaDoc at the Bottom right of the Auto Comment
screen these being <tt>&lt;B&gt; &lt;I&gt; &lt;U&gt; &lt;CODE&gt; &lt;PRE&gt;

&lt;@link&gt;.</tt>
</p><p>Very powerful.</p>
<h2>Refreshing Auto Comment</h2>
<p>
Sometimes you have to go back to your code. For example when you forget to start your comment block with
two stars Auto Comment can't find your comment so you have to click
on View source and check. If you have made a mistake and then you
flick back to Auto Comment its always a good idea just to click on
the <b>refresh</b> button just to make sure you don't duplicate your
work.</p>
<h2>Auto Correct</h2>
<p>Lets say you have a method that has
many parameters typing all the parameter names would take sometime.
The Auto Correct feature creates all the parameter tags and names
them for you so all you have to do is add the comment. You do this by
selecting the method you want to comment and clicking on the <b>Auto
Correct</b> button you then add your comments in the parameter
<b>Description</b> field.
</p>
<h2>When Your Finished</h2>
<p>Make sure you save your hard work by clicking on the <b>save all</b> button in your tool bar.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Now you know how to use the <b>Auto Comment</b> feature and how much time it can save you. There will be
no excuse not  to comment your code. As an experiment, run it on some
of your old code you will be in for a surprise!!</p>
