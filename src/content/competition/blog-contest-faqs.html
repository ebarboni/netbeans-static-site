<h4>5) Will blog entries be featured on NetBeans.org?</h4>
The blog contest is to encourage users to share their experiences about
using the NetBeans IDE, so we will occasionally feature select blog
entries on the contest page. However, a submitted blog post that
appears on NetBeans.org is not confirmation that the entry has been
selected for judging.<br>
<br>
If you blog regularly about the NetBeans consider adding your blog to <a
 href="http://planetnetbeans.org/">Planet NetBeans</a>, our directory
of community blogs about all things NetBeans related! Planet NetBeans
currently features blogs in 13 languages! <br>
<h4>6) What are the prizes? </h4>
First Prize: The top 10 winners will receive a $500 American Express
Gift Certificate. <br>
<br>
Second Prize: Each of the next top one hundred (100) blog entries will
receive a NetBeans T-Shirt.<br>
<br>
<h4>7) Who are the judges?</h4>
All the entries will be judged by a panel of experts on NetBeans. The
panel will be made up of (composed of) members of the NetBeans
community at large, including, but not limited to Sun employees,
non-Sun contributors, and Dream Team members from each of the following
language groups: US, Spain, Russia, France, China, Portugal, Japan and
Poland. &nbsp;<br>
<br>
<h4>8)What criteria will the judges use to judge the contest? </h4>
The panel of experts will judge each entry based on the following
equally weighted judging criteria: novelty and originality of the blog
entry; usefulness and character of the substantive feedback; the blog's
interest and appeal to other users of NetBeans 6.1 IDE Beta; clarity in
the expression about the user experience; how the blog demonstrates or
showcases specific features; and/or the ability to use the blog to
improve any aspect of NetBeans 6.1 IDE Beta. <br>
<br>
<h4>9)What is the deadline for submissions?</h4>
The submission deadline is 11:59 P.M. (PT) which is 8:59 A.M. (GMT) on
April 18, 2008. <br>
<br>
<h4>10) When will the winners be announced?</h4>
