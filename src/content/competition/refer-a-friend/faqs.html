    <h4><a name="one">What is the NetBeans Refer-a-Friend Promotion?</a></h4>
The
NetBeans Refer-a-Friend Promotion is a program to reward NetBeans users
who recommend the NetBeans IDE to their friends and encourage their
friends to download the IDE. </li>
  <li>
    <h4><a name="two">What do I get for referring my friends to
download the NetBeans IDE?</a></h4>
For
successfully getting three or more friends to download the
NetBeans IDE you will receive a gift: a 2GB USB drive preloaded with
select NetBeans documentation and videos, and OpenOffice, a free
productivity suite. </li>
  <li>
    <h4><a name="three"> How do I participate in the NetBeans
Refer-a-Friend promotion?</a></h4>
It's easy. Visit the <a href="index.html">NetBeans Refer-a-Friend
Promotion page</a> and fill out the registration form. The form
contains fields for
your friends' email addresses and an email invitation that you can
personalize.</li>
  <li>
    <h4><a name="four">How many friends can I refer?</a></h4>
You must refer a minimum of five unique friends who have not been
referred by other users participating in the promotion.<br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4><a name="five"> Can I refer my friends without using the
registration form and just point them to
the NetBeans Download page?</a></h4>
No. You must use the promotion's registration form and email
invitation.
The email invitation contains a unique download link for your friends
to use. This link lets us verify that your friends have downloaded the
NetBeans IDE, therefore we can give you credit towards receiving your
gift.</li>
  <li>
    <h4><a name="six">I don't see the unique download link in the email
template. Can I just copy and paste the regular NetBeans download url?</a></h4>
No,
do not include any other download link in the email invitation. The
unique download link is not visible to you, but is
automatically inserted into your email message when you submit the
registration form and the invite is sent out.<br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4><a name="elig">Why isn't my country eligible to participate?
    </a></h4>
The list of eligible countries is limited by the countries' local laws
that allow such competitions.<br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4><a name="filter">Why did my friends never receive the
invitation? </a></h4>
It's possible that you misspelled their email address, or that the
message was caught by their a spam prevention tool. Ask them to check
their spam folders. If they have a challenge-response system enabled
that expects a human reply they will not be able to receive the
invitations. <br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4><a name="seven"> I entered my friend's email address in the
registration form, but the address was rejected.
    </a></h4>
There are two possible reasons why this may have happened: 1)
Your friend's email address is in our <span style="font-style: italic;">Do-Not-Contact</span>
list, that is, he/she at some point chose
to opt out of receiving email notifications from NetBeans. 2) Your
friend's email address has already been used by another participant in
the promotion.<br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4><a name="eight">How will I know if my friends have downloaded
the NetBeans IDE?</a></h4>
We will send you an email alert whenever your referred friends download
the NetBeans IDE. Please remember: the email invitation you send when
registering for the promotion
contains a unique download link that your friends MUST use to download
the NetBeans IDE. This is the only way we can give you credit towards
receiving your gift.<br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4><a name="nine"> How many friends need to download the NetBeans
IDE before I
qualify for the gift?</a> </h4>
At least three of your friends must download the NetBeans IDE for you
to qualify to receive the gift. <br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4><a name="ten">How and when will I get my gift?</a></h4>
We will contact you and verify your mailing information after three of
your friends have downloaded NetBeans IDE. After the verification
process, it will take an additional 4 - 6 weeks to receive your gift.
Please be patient.<br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4><a name="eleven">Can I enter the promotion more than once?</a></h4>
No. You can participate in the promotion only once.<br>
  </li>
  <li>
    <h4><a name="twelve">Can I get an extra gift if more than three
friends download the NetBeans IDE?</a></h4>
No. You can receive only one gift per three or more successful referral
downloads of the NetBeans IDE.</li>
