The NetBeans Refer-a-Friend Promotion is now closed. The promotion was a huge success—thousands of developers around the world downloaded the NetBeans IDE and then spread the message to their friends to do the same! The NetBeans Team thanks everyone who participated in this campaign!<br><br>

We are currently verifying mailing addresses of qualified entries, and will be shipping out the 2GB USB sticks in April.<br><br>

              <!--The NetBeans IDE has always
              enjoyed word-of-mouth success—developers
              tell their friends about how the tool has radically improved their
              development experience, and then recommend that their friends give
              the IDE a try. We want you as a new user to be a part of this
              movement. The good news is: we will reward you for it!<br>
              <br>
              Tell your friends about the NetBeans IDE, and if they download the IDE
              as a result we send you a 2GB USB drive preloaded with selected
              NetBeans Documentation, as well as OpenOffice, Sun's free and popular
              productivity suite!<br>
