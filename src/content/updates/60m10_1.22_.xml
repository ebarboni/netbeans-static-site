3. Distribution Obligations. 



3.1. Availability of Source Code. Any Covered Software that You 

distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form must 

also be made available in Source Code form and that Source Code 

form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. 

You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the 

Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or 

otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any 

such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can 

obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a 

reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for 

software exchange. 



3.2. Modifications. The Modifications that You create or to 

which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License. 

You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your 

original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to 

grant the rights conveyed by this License. 



3.3. Required Notices. You must include a notice in each of 

Your Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of 

the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, 

patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, 

or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving 

attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer. 



3.4. Application of Additional Terms. You may not offer or 

impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form 

that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License 

or the recipients rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, 

and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or 

liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered 

Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, 

and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. 

You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, 

support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You 

alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer 

and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial 

Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, 

indemnity or liability terms You offer.



3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute 

the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms 

of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, 

which may contain terms different from this License, provided 

that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and 

that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to 

limit or alter the recipients rights in the Source Code form 

from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute 

the Covered Software in Executable form under a different 

license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms 

which differ from this License are offered by You alone, 

not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby 

agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor 

for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such 

Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. 



3.6. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining 

Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms of 

this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. 

In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this 

License are fulfilled for the Covered Software. 



4. Versions of the License. 



4.1. New Versions. Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial 

license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions 

of this License from time to time. Each version will be given 

a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 



4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to 

modify this License. 



4.2. Effect of New Versions. You may always continue to use, 

distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available 

under the terms of the version of the License under which You 

originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial 

Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting 

it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any 

subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make 

the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of

 the License under which You originally received the Covered 

Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or 

otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms 

of any subsequent version of the License published by the 

license steward. 



4.3. Modified Versions. When You are an Initial Developer and 

You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, 

You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: 

(a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of 

the license steward (except to note that the license differs 

from this License); and 

(b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms 

which differ from this License. 



5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER 

THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, 

EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, 

WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, 

MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. 

THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED 

SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE 

IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER 

CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, 

REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES 

AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED 

SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 



6. TERMINATION. 



6.1. This License and the rights granted 

hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to 

comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach 

within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions 

which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the 

termination of this License shall survive. 



6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding 

declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer 

or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor 

against whom You assert such claim is referred to as 

Participant) alleging that the Participant Software 

(meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is 

a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant 

is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes 

any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or 

indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer 

(if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all 

Contributors under Sections 



2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice 

from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically 

at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if 

within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with 

respect to the Participant Software against such Participant 

either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with 

Participant. 



6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 



6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been 

validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder 

prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You 

by any distributor) shall survive termination. 



7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND 

UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), 

CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, 

ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, 

OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY 

PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL 

DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, 

DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, 

COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER 

COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL 

HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 

THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY 

FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS 

NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH 

LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION 

OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO 

THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 



8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. The Covered Software is a 

commercial item, as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 

(Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer software 

(as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 252.227-7014(a)(1)) 

and commercial computer software documentation as such terms 

are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 

48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 

(June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered 

Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. 

Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any 

other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses 

Government rights in computer software under this License. 



9. MISCELLANEOUS. This License represents the complete 

agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision 

of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision 

shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it 

enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of 

the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within 

the Original Software (except to the extent applicable 

law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdictions 

conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this 

License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts 

located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice 

contained within the Original Software, with the losing 

party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, 

court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. 

The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts 

for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. 

Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a 

contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not 

apply to this License. You agree that You alone are 

responsible for compliance with the United States export 

administration regulations (and the export control laws 

and regulation of any other countries) when You use, 

distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.



10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. As between Initial Developer 

and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims 

and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its 

utilization of rights under this License and You agree to 

work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute 

such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein 

is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission 

of liability. 



------------------------------------------------------------

NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND 

DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL): This code is released under 

the CDDL and shall be governed by the laws of the State of 

California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any

Your exclusive remedy and Sun's entire liability under this limited warranty will be at Sun's option to replace Software media or refund the fee paid for Software. 

4. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.  UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE LEGALLY INVALID. 

5. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.  TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.  In no event will Sun's liability to you, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount paid by you for Software under this Agreement.

11. Integration.  This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Sun relating to its subject matter.  It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, representations and warranties and prevails over any conflicting or additional terms of any quote, order, acknowledgment, or other communication between the parties relating to its subject matter during the term of this Agreement.  No modification of this Agreement will be binding, unless in writing and signed by an authorized representative of each party.

      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade

      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the

      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason

The parties agree that the Federal District Court for the Northern District of California shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute involving exclusively federal causes of action.  That court and the California state courts in Santa Clara County, California shall have exclusive jurisdiction over all other disputes. The parties hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction of those courts. Choice of law rules of any jurisdiction and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to the Agreement or any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement.
 11.2 Licensee agrees that the Technology and technical data delivered under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export laws (including but not limited to the Export Administration Regulations ("EAR": 15  C.F.R. Parts 730-774)) and applicable trade laws of other countries.  Licensee agrees to strictly comply with all such laws and assumes responsibility to obtain licenses to export, re-export, or import as may be required. Unless authorized by United States export laws, Licensee agrees that (i)�no Technology or technical data or direct product therefrom is being or will be acquired for, shipment, transfer, or re-export, directly or indirectly, to: a) any country subject to U.S. Embargo or terrorist controls or b) a country and its nationals in Country Group D:1 as listed in Part 740 Supplement 1 of the EAR; (ii)  Licensee nor any party to whom Technology and technical data are transferred is not identified on any U.S. Government export exclusion lists; and (iii) Technology and technical data will not be used for nuclear, missile, chemical biological weaponry, or other weapons of mass destruction. These obligations shall survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.

 11.4 It is understood and agreed that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Licensee's breach of Sections 2.0 (Limited Licenses), 3.0 (Restrictions), 6.0 (Term and Termination), and/or 7.0 (Confidential Information) of this Agreement will cause Sun irreparable damage for which recovery of money damages would be inadequate, and that Sun will therefore be entitled to seek injunctive relief to protect Sun's rights under this  Agreement, without posting bond or other security, in addition to any and all other remedies available under this Agreement, at law, and in equity.
 11.5 Neither party may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other party, except that Sun may assign this Agreement to an affiliated company without such consent.
 11.6 If any term or provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid under any applicable statute or rule of law, such provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
 11.7 No modification to this Agreement will be binding, unless in writing and manually signed by an authorized representative of each party.
 11.8 This Agreement, constitutes the parties' entire agreement relating to its subject matter. It cancels and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous oral and written communications, proposals, conditions, representations and warranties and prevails over any conflicting or additional terms contained in any quote, purchase order, acknowledgment, or other communication between the parties relating to its subject matter during its term, including but not limited to terms of any Binary Code Licenses, Supplemental Terms, or other standard licenses accompanying the Technology.

Your rights under this Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from Sun if you materially breach it or take any action in derogation of Sun's and/or its licensors' rights to Software. Sun may terminate this Agreement should any Software become, or in Sun's reasonable opinion likely to become, the subject of a claim of intellectual property infringement or trade secret misappropriation. Upon termination, you will cease use of, and destroy, Software and confirm compliance in writing to Sun. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 9-15 will survive termination of the Agreement.

7.	Java Compatibility and Open Source.

Sun supports and benefits from the global community of open source developers, and thanks the community for its important contributions and open standards-based technology, which Sun has adopted into many of its products.

Please note that portions of Software may be provided with notices and open source licenses from such communities and third parties that govern the use of those portions, and any licenses granted hereunder do not alter any rights and obligations you may have under such open source licenses, however, the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provisions in this Agreement will apply to all Software in this distribution.

8. 	Limited Warranty.

Sun warrants to you that for a period of 90 days from the date of purchase, as evidenced by a copy of the receipt, the media on which Software is furnished (if any) will be free of defects in materials and workmanship under normal use. Except for the foregoing, Software is provided "AS IS". Your exclusive remedy and Sun's entire liability under this limited warranty will be at Sun's option to replace Software media or refund the fee paid for Software. Some states do not allow limitations on certain implied warranties, so the above may not apply to you. This limited warranty gives you specific legal rights. You may have others, which vary from state to state.

9.	Disclaimer of Warranty.

UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE LEGALLY INVALID.

10. 	Limitation of Liability.

TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. In no event will Sun's liability to you, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount paid by you for Software under this Agreement. The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its essential purpose. Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental or consequential damages, so some of the terms above may not be applicable to you.

11. 	Export Regulations.

All Software, documents, technical data, and any other materials delivered under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries.

13. 	Governing Law.

Any action related to this Agreement will be governed by California law and controlling U.S. federal law. No choice of law rules of any jurisdiction will apply.

LEGAL ISSUES
============

In plain English:

1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs,
   please let us know!)
2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us.
3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a
   program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that
   you've used the IJG code.

In legalese:

The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or
fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you,
its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.

This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane.
All Rights Reserved except as specified below.

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
conditions:
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
the Independent JPEG Group".
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
acknowledge us.

Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
software".

We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
assumed by the product vendor.


ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
the foregoing paragraphs do.

The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright
by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.

It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by
patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot
legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason,
support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.
(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented
Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)
So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining
code.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
"uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
GIF decoders.

We are required to state that
    "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
    CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
    CompuServe Incorporated."

 *      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 *      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 *      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 *      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 *      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 *      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 *      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 *      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 *
 *   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 *      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,

 *      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 *      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 *      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 *      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 *      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability

Version 2.1, February 1999

Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users.

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially
designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software
Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we
suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary
General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case,
based on the explanations below.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom
to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish);
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change
the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are
informed that you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to
deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
copies of the library or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make
sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code
with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so
that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library
and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and
(2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the library.

To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no
warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else
and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the
original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected
by problems that might be introduced by others.

Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free
program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the
users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.
Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the
library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU
General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License,
applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the
ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in
order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared
library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a
derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License
therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria
of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for
linking other code with the library.

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to
protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also
provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing
non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary
General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides
advantages in certain special circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the
widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto
standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library.
A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used
non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free
library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs
enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For
example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many
more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the
GNU/Linux operating system.

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users'
freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the
Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified
version of the Library.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the
library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived
from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order
to run.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party
saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public
License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as
to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those
functions and data) to form executables.

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been
distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the
Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications
and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter,
translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source
code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition
files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the
Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its
contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the
Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the
Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along
with the Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at
your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus
forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
these conditions:

    * a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
    * b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating
that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    * c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all
third parties under the terms of this License.
    * d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table
of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other
than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a
good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply
such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part
of its purpose remains meaningful.

      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a
purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore,
Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by
this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the
square root function must still compute square roots.)

      These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,
and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

      Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the
Library.

      In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage
or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
License. 

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License
instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must
alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the
ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If
a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has
appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make
any other change in these notices.

Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so
the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and
derivative works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into
a program that is not a library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1
and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from
the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even
though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object
code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is
designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called
a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative
work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an
executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of
the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is
therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of
such executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is
part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of
the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is
especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the
work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely
defined by law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts
and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in
length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether
it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus
portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the
object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables
containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked
directly with the Library itself.

6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work
that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of
the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that
the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is
used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You
must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays
copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among
them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License.
Also, you must do one of these things:

    * a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work
(which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an
executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work
that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can
modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing
the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents
of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile
the application to use the modified definitions.)
    * b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A
suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library
already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library
functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified
version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified
version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
    * c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above,
for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.
    * d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a
designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials
from the same place.
    * e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or
that you have already sent this user a copy. 

For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must
include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from
it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not
include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form)
with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system
on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of
other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system.
Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in
an executable that you distribute.

7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not
covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that
the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other
library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two
things:

    * a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on
the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be
distributed under the terms of the Sections above.
    * b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part
of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
accompanying uncombined form of the same work. 

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who
have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their
licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library
or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any
work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do
so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
Library or works based on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library),
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and
conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
compliance by third parties with this License.

11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all.
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of
the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,
then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many
people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
consequence of the rest of this License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright
holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit
geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such
case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies
a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version",
you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version
or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version
ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs
whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author
to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions
for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and
reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE
LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED
IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS
IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY
TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use
to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can
redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these
terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the
exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line
and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.
Copyright (C) year  name of author

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
Lesser General Public License for more details.

You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. Here is
a sample; alter the names:

Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in
the library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written

(k) No right, title or interest in or to any trademark, service mark, logo or trade name of Sun or its licensors is granted under this Agreement.

6.	Term and Termination.

The license and service term are set forth in your Entitlement(s). Your rights under this Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from Sun if you materially breach it or take any action in derogation of Sun's and/or its licensors' rights to Software. Sun may terminate this Agreement should any Software become, or in Sun's reasonable opinion likely to become, the subject of a claim of intellectual property infringement or trade secret misappropriation. Upon termination, you will cease use of, and destroy, Software and confirm compliance in writing to Sun. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 9-15 will survive termination of the Agreement.

7.	Java Compatibility and Open Source.

Software may contain Java technology. You may not create additional classes to, or modifications of, the Java technology, except under compatibility requirements available under a separate agreement available at www.java.net.

Sun supports and benefits from the global community of open source developers, and thanks the community for its important contributions and open standards-based technology, which Sun has adopted into many of its products.

Please note that portions of Software may be provided with notices and open source licenses from such communities and third parties that govern the use of those portions, and any licenses granted hereunder do not alter any rights and obligations you may have under such open source licenses, however, the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provisions in this Agreement will apply to all Software in this distribution.

8. 	Limited Warranty.

Sun warrants to you that for a period of 90 days from the date of purchase, as evidenced by a copy of the receipt, the media on which Software is furnished (if any) will be free of defects in materials and workmanship under normal use. Except for the foregoing, Software is provided "AS IS". Your exclusive remedy and Sun's entire liability under this limited warranty will be at Sun's option to replace Software media or refund the fee paid for Software. Some states do not allow limitations on certain implied warranties, so the above may not apply to you. This limited warranty gives you specific legal rights. You may have others, which vary from state to state.

9.	Disclaimer of Warranty.

UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE LEGALLY INVALID.

10. 	Limitation of Liability.

TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. In no event will Sun's liability to you, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount paid by you for Software under this Agreement. The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its essential purpose. Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental or consequential damages, so some of the terms above may not be applicable to you.

11. 	Export Regulations.

All Software, documents, technical data, and any other materials delivered under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries. You agree to comply strictly with these laws and regulations and acknowledge that you have the responsibility to obtain any licenses to export, re-export, or import as may be required after delivery to you.

12. 	U.S. Government Restricted Rights.

If Software is being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S. Government or by a U.S. Government prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier), then the Government's rights in Software and accompanying documentation will be only as set forth in this Agreement; this is in accordance with 48 CFR 227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense (DOD) acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD acquisitions).

13. 	Governing Law.

Any action related to this Agreement will be governed by California law and controlling U.S. federal law. No choice of law rules of any jurisdiction will apply.

14. 	Severability.

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this Agreement will remain in effect with the provision omitted, unless omission would frustrate the intent of the parties, in which case this Agreement will immediately terminate.

15. 	Integration.

This Agreement, including any terms contained in your Entitlement, is the entire agreement between you and Sun relating to its subject matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, representations and warranties and prevails over any conflicting or additional terms of any quote, order, acknowledgment, or other communication between the parties relating to its subject matter during the term of this Agreement. No modification of this Agreement will be binding, unless in writing and signed by an authorized representative of each party.

LEGAL ISSUES
============

In plain English:

1. We don't promise that this software works.  (But if you find any bugs,
   please let us know!)
2. You can use this software for whatever you want.  You don't have to pay us.
3. You may not pretend that you wrote this software.  If you use it in a
   program, you must acknowledge somewhere in your documentation that
   you've used the IJG code.

In legalese:

The authors make NO WARRANTY or representation, either express or implied,
with respect to this software, its quality, accuracy, merchantability, or
fitness for a particular purpose.  This software is provided "AS IS", and you,
its user, assume the entire risk as to its quality and accuracy.

This software is copyright (C) 1991-1998, Thomas G. Lane.
All Rights Reserved except as specified below.

Permission is hereby granted to use, copy, modify, and distribute this
software (or portions thereof) for any purpose, without fee, subject to these
conditions:
(1) If any part of the source code for this software is distributed, then this
README file must be included, with this copyright and no-warranty notice
unaltered; and any additions, deletions, or changes to the original files
must be clearly indicated in accompanying documentation.
(2) If only executable code is distributed, then the accompanying
documentation must state that "this software is based in part on the work of
the Independent JPEG Group".
(3) Permission for use of this software is granted only if the user accepts
full responsibility for any undesirable consequences; the authors accept
NO LIABILITY for damages of any kind.

These conditions apply to any software derived from or based on the IJG code,
not just to the unmodified library.  If you use our work, you ought to
acknowledge us.

Permission is NOT granted for the use of any IJG author's name or company name
in advertising or publicity relating to this software or products derived from
it.  This software may be referred to only as "the Independent JPEG Group's
software".

We specifically permit and encourage the use of this software as the basis of
commercial products, provided that all warranty or liability claims are
assumed by the product vendor.


ansi2knr.c is included in this distribution by permission of L. Peter Deutsch,
sole proprietor of its copyright holder, Aladdin Enterprises of Menlo Park, CA.
ansi2knr.c is NOT covered by the above copyright and conditions, but instead
by the usual distribution terms of the Free Software Foundation; principally,
that you must include source code if you redistribute it.  (See the file
ansi2knr.c for full details.)  However, since ansi2knr.c is not needed as part
of any program generated from the IJG code, this does not limit you more than
the foregoing paragraphs do.

The Unix configuration script "configure" was produced with GNU Autoconf.
It is copyright by the Free Software Foundation but is freely distributable.
The same holds for its supporting scripts (config.guess, config.sub,
ltconfig, ltmain.sh).  Another support script, install-sh, is copyright
by M.I.T. but is also freely distributable.

It appears that the arithmetic coding option of the JPEG spec is covered by
patents owned by IBM, AT&T, and Mitsubishi.  Hence arithmetic coding cannot
legally be used without obtaining one or more licenses.  For this reason,
support for arithmetic coding has been removed from the free JPEG software.
(Since arithmetic coding provides only a marginal gain over the unpatented
Huffman mode, it is unlikely that very many implementations will support it.)
So far as we are aware, there are no patent restrictions on the remaining
code.

The IJG distribution formerly included code to read and write GIF files.
To avoid entanglement with the Unisys LZW patent, GIF reading support has
been removed altogether, and the GIF writer has been simplified to produce
"uncompressed GIFs".  This technique does not use the LZW algorithm; the
resulting GIF files are larger than usual, but are readable by all standard
GIF decoders.

We are required to state that
    "The Graphics Interchange Format(c) is the Copyright property of
    CompuServe Incorporated.  GIF(sm) is a Service Mark property of
    CompuServe Incorporated."

 *      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or

 *
 *      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
 *      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
 *      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications

 *      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain

 *      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

 *      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
 *      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
 *      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
 *      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
 *      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
 *      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
 *      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the

 *      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
 *
 *      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
 *      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
 *      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
 *
 *   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
 *      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
 *      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
 *      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
 *      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
 *      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
 *
 *   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
 *      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
 *      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
 *      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
 *      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
 *      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
 *      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
 *      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
 *      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
 *      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
 *      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
 *      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
 *      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
 *      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
 *      as of the date such litigation is filed.
 *
 *   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
 *      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
 *      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
 *      meet the following conditions:
 *
 *      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
 *          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
 *
 *      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
 *          stating that You changed the files; and
 *
 *      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
 *          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
 *          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
 *          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
 *          the Derivative Works; and
 *
 *      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
 *          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
 *          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
 *          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
 *          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
 *          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
 *          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
 *          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
 *          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
 *          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
 *          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
 *          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
 *          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
 *          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
 *          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
 *          as modifying the License.
 *
 *      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 *      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 *      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 *      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 *      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 *      the conditions stated in this License.
 *
 *   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 *      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 *      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
 *      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
 *      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
 *      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
 *      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 *
 *   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
 *      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
 *      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
 *      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 *
 *   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
 *      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
 *      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
 *      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
 *      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
 *      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
 *      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 *      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
 *      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 *
 *   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
 *      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 *      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 *      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 *      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 *      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 *      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 *      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 *      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 *      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 *      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 *
 *   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 *      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 *      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 *      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 *      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 *      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 *      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 *      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 *      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 *      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
 *
 *   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 *
 *   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
 *
 *      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
 *      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users.

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially
designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software
Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we
suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary
General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case,
based on the explanations below.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom
to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish);
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change
the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are
informed that you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to
deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
copies of the library or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make
sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code
with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so
that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library
and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and
(2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the library.

To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no
warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else
and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the
original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected
by problems that might be introduced by others.

Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free
program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the
users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.
Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the
library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU
General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License,
applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the
ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in
order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared
library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a
derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License
therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria
of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for
linking other code with the library.

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to
protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also
provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing
non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary
General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides
advantages in certain special circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the
widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto
standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library.
A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used
non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free
library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs
enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For
example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many
more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the
GNU/Linux operating system.

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users'
freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the
Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified
version of the Library.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the
library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived
from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order
to run.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party
saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public
License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as
to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those
functions and data) to form executables.

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been
distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the
Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications
and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter,
translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source
code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition
files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the
Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its
contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the
Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the
Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along
with the Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at
your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus
forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
these conditions:

    * a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
    * b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating
that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    * c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all
third parties under the terms of this License.
    * d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table
of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other
than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a
good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply
such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part
of its purpose remains meaningful.

      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a
purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore,
Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by
this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the
square root function must still compute square roots.)

      These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,
and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

      Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the
Library.

      In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage
or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
License. 

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License
instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must
alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the
ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If
a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has
appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make
any other change in these notices.

Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so
the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and
derivative works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into
a program that is not a library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1
and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from
the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even
though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object
code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is
designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called
a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative
work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an
executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of
the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is
therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of
such executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is
part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of
the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is
especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the
work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely
defined by law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts
and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in
length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether
it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus
portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the
object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables
containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked
directly with the Library itself.

6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work
that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of
the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that
the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is
used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You
must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays
copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among
them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License.
Also, you must do one of these things:

    * a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work
(which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an
executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work
that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can
modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing
the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents
of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile
the application to use the modified definitions.)
    * b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A
suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library
already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library
functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified
version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified
version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
    * c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above,
for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.
    * d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a
designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials
from the same place.
    * e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or
that you have already sent this user a copy. 

For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must
include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from
it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not
include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form)
with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system
on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of
other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system.
Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in
an executable that you distribute.

7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not
covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that
the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other
library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two
things:

    * a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on
the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be
distributed under the terms of the Sections above.
    * b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part
of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
accompanying uncombined form of the same work. 

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who
have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their
licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library
or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any
work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do
so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
Library or works based on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library),
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and
conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
compliance by third parties with this License.

11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all.
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of
the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,
then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many
people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
consequence of the rest of this License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright
holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit
geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such
case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies
a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version",
you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version
or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version
ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs
whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author
to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions
for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and
reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE
LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED
IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS
IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY
TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use
to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can
redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these
terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the
exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line
and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.
Copyright (C) year  name of author

This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public

version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. Here is
a sample; alter the names:

              SUPPLEMENTAL LICENSE TERMS

These supplemental license terms ("Supplemental Terms") add to or modify the terms of the Binary Code License Agreement (collectively, the "Agreement"). Capitalized terms not defined in these Supplemental Terms shall have the same meanings ascribed to them in the Agreement. These Supplemental Terms shall supersede any inconsistent or conflicting terms in the Agreement, or in any license contained within the Software.

1. Software Internal Use and Development License Grant. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, but not limited to Section 2 (Java Technology Restrictions) of these Supplemental Terms, Sun grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited license to reproduce internally and use internally the binary form of the Software complete and unmodified for the sole purpose of designing, developing and testing your Java applets and applications intended to run on the Java platform ("Programs") provided that any executable output generated by a compiler that is contained in the Software must (a) only be compiled from source code that conforms to the corresponding version of the OEM Java Language Specification; (b) be in the class file format defined by the corresponding version of the OEM Java Virtual Machine Specification; and (c) execute properly on a reference runtime, as specified by Sun, associated with such version of the Java platform.

2. Java Technology Restrictions. You may not modify the Java Platform Interface ("JPI", identified as classes contained within the "java" package or any subpackages of the "java" package), by creating additional classes within the JPI or otherwise causing the addition to or modification of the classes in the JPI. In the event that you create an additional class and associated API(s) which (i) extends the functionality of the Java platform, and (ii) is exposed to third party software developers for the purpose of developing additional software which invokes such additional API, you must promptly publish broadly an accurate specification for such API for free use by all developers. You may not create, or authorize your licensees to create, additional classes, interfaces, or subpackages that are in any way identified as "java", "javax", "sun" or similar convention as specified by Sun in any naming convention designation.

3. Java Runtime Availability. Refer to the appropriate version of the Java Runtime Environment binary code license (currently located at http://www.java.sun.com/jdk/index.html) for the availability of runtime code which may be distributed with Java applets and applications.

3. Distribution Obligations. 

3.1. Availability of Source Code. Any Covered Software that You 
distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form must 
also be made available in Source Code form and that Source Code 
form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. 
You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the 
Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or 
otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any 
such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can 
obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a 
reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for 
software exchange. 

3.2. Modifications. The Modifications that You create or to 
which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License. 
You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your 
original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to 
grant the rights conveyed by this License. 

3.3. Required Notices. You must include a notice in each of 
Your Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of 
the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, 
patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, 
or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving 
attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer. 

3.4. Application of Additional Terms. You may not offer or 
impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form 
that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License 
or the recipients rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, 
and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or 
liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered 
Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, 
and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. 
You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, 
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You 
alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer 
and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial 
Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, 
indemnity or liability terms You offer.

3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute 
the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms 
of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, 
which may contain terms different from this License, provided 
that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and 
that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to 
limit or alter the recipients rights in the Source Code form 
from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute 
the Covered Software in Executable form under a different 
license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms 
which differ from this License are offered by You alone, 
not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby 
agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor 
for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such 
Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. 

3.6. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining 
Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms of 
this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. 
In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this 
License are fulfilled for the Covered Software. 

4. Versions of the License. 

4.1. New Versions. Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial 
license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions 
of this License from time to time. Each version will be given 
a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 

4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to 
modify this License. 

4.2. Effect of New Versions. You may always continue to use, 
distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available 
under the terms of the version of the License under which You 
originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial 
Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting 
it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any 
subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make 
the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of
 the License under which You originally received the Covered 
Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or 
otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms 
of any subsequent version of the License published by the 
license steward. 

4.3. Modified Versions. When You are an Initial Developer and 
You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, 
You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: 
(a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of 
the license steward (except to note that the license differs 
from this License); and 
(b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms 
which differ from this License. 

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER 
THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, 
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, 
WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, 
MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. 
THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED 
SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE 
IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER 
CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, 
REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES 
AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED 
SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 

6. TERMINATION. 

6.1. This License and the rights granted 
hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to 
comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach 
within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions 
which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the 
termination of this License shall survive. 

6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding 
declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer 
or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor 
against whom You assert such claim is referred to as 
Participant) alleging that the Participant Software 
(meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is 
a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant 
is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes 
any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or 
indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer 
(if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all 
Contributors under Sections 

2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice 
from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically 
at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if 
within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with 
respect to the Participant Software against such Participant 
either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with 
Participant. 

6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 

6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been 
validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder 
prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You 
by any distributor) shall survive termination. 

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND 
UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), 
CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, 
ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, 
OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY 
PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, 
DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, 
COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER 
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL 
HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY 
FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS 
NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH 
LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION 
OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO 
THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. The Covered Software is a 
commercial item, as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 
(Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer software 
(as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 252.227-7014(a)(1)) 
and commercial computer software documentation as such terms 
are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 
48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 
(June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered 
Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. 
Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any 
other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses 
Government rights in computer software under this License. 

9. MISCELLANEOUS. This License represents the complete 
agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision 
of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision 
shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it 
enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of 
the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within 
the Original Software (except to the extent applicable 
law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdictions 
conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this 
License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts 
located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice 
contained within the Original Software, with the losing 
party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, 
court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. 
The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts 
for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. 
Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a 
contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not 
apply to this License. You agree that You alone are 
responsible for compliance with the United States export 
administration regulations (and the export control laws 
and regulation of any other countries) when You use, 
distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. As between Initial Developer 
and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims 
and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its 
utilization of rights under this License and You agree to 
work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute 
such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein 
is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission 
of liability.

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without

          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works

          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its

          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided

      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

 11.4 It is understood and agreed that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Licensee's breach of Sections 2.0 (Limited Licenses), 3.0 (Restrictions), 6.0 (Term and Termination), and/or 7.0 (Confidential Information) of this Agreement will cause Sun irreparable damage for which recovery of money damages would be inadequate, and that Sun will therefore be entitled to seek injunctive relief to protect Sun's rights under this  Agreement, without posting bond or other security, in addition to any and all other remedies available under this Agreement, at law, and in equity.
 11.5 Neither party may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other party, except that Sun may assign this Agreement to an affiliated company without such consent.
 11.6 If any term or provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid under any applicable statute or rule of law, such provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
 11.7 No modification to this Agreement will be binding, unless in writing and manually signed by an authorized representative of each party.
 11.8 This Agreement, constitutes the parties' entire agreement relating to its subject matter. It cancels and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous oral and written communications, proposals, conditions, representations and warranties and prevails over any conflicting or additional terms contained in any quote, purchase order, acknowledgment, or other communication between the parties relating to its subject matter during its term, including but not limited to terms of any Binary Code Licenses, Supplemental Terms, or other standard licenses accompanying the Technology.

GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE

Version 2.1, February 1999

Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it. By contrast, the GNU General Public Licenses are intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users.

This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some specially
designated software packages--typically libraries--of the Free Software
Foundation and other authors who decide to use it. You can use it too, but we
suggest you first think carefully about whether this license or the ordinary
General Public License is the better strategy to use in any particular case,
based on the explanations below.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use, not price.
Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom
to distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish);
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it; that you can change
the software and use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you are
informed that you can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid distributors to
deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these rights. These
restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute
copies of the library or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis or for a
fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave you. You must make
sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code. If you link other code
with the library, you must provide complete object files to the recipients, so
that they can relink them with the library after making changes to the library
and recompiling it. And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the library, and
(2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal permission to copy,
distribute and/or modify the library.

To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that there is no
warranty for the free library. Also, if the library is modified by someone else
and passed on, the recipients should know that what they have is not the
original version, so that the original author's reputation will not be affected
by problems that might be introduced by others.

Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of any free
program. We wish to make sure that a company cannot effectively restrict the
users of a free program by obtaining a restrictive license from a patent holder.
Therefore, we insist that any patent license obtained for a version of the
library must be consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the ordinary GNU
General Public License. This license, the GNU Lesser General Public License,
applies to certain designated libraries, and is quite different from the
ordinary General Public License. We use this license for certain libraries in
order to permit linking those libraries into non-free programs.

When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using a shared
library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a combined work, a
derivative of the original library. The ordinary General Public License
therefore permits such linking only if the entire combination fits its criteria
of freedom. The Lesser General Public License permits more lax criteria for
linking other code with the library.

We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it does Less to
protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General Public License. It also
provides other free software developers Less of an advantage over competing
non-free programs. These disadvantages are the reason we use the ordinary
General Public License for many libraries. However, the Lesser license provides
advantages in certain special circumstances.

For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage the
widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto
standard. To achieve this, non-free programs must be allowed to use the library.
A more frequent case is that a free library does the same job as widely used
non-free libraries. In this case, there is little to gain by limiting the free
library to free software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free programs
enables a greater number of people to use a large body of free software. For
example, permission to use the GNU C Library in non-free programs enables many
more people to use the whole GNU operating system, as well as its variant, the
GNU/Linux operating system.

Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the users'
freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with the
Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a modified
version of the Library.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow. Pay close attention to the difference between a "work based on the
library" and a "work that uses the library". The former contains code derived
from the library, whereas the latter must be combined with the library in order
to run.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other program which
contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or other authorized party
saying it may be distributed under the terms of this Lesser General Public
License (also called "this License"). Each licensee is addressed as "you".

A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data prepared so as
to be conveniently linked with application programs (which use some of those
functions and data) to form executables.

The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work which has been
distributed under these terms. A "work based on the Library" means either the
Library or any derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work
containing the Library or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications
and/or translated straightforwardly into another language. (Hereinafter,
translation is included without limitation in the term "modification".)

"Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it. For a library, complete source code means all the source
code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface definition
files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation of the library.

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
this License; they are outside its scope. The act of running a program using the
Library is not restricted, and output from such a program is covered only if its
contents constitute a work based on the Library (independent of the use of the
Library in a tool for writing it). Whether that is true depends on what the
Library does and what the program that uses the Library does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's complete source
code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
and to the absence of any warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along
with the Library.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may at
your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it, thus
forming a work based on the Library, and copy and distribute such modifications
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
these conditions:

    * a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
    * b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices stating
that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    * c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no charge to all
third parties under the terms of this License.
    * d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a table
of data to be supplied by an application program that uses the facility, other
than as an argument passed when the facility is invoked, then you must make a
good faith effort to ensure that, in the event an application does not supply
such function or table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part
of its purpose remains meaningful.

      (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has a
purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the application. Therefore,
Subsection 2d requires that any application-supplied function or table used by
this function must be optional: if the application does not supply it, the
square root function must still compute square roots.)

      These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole. If identifiable
sections of that work are not derived from the Library, and can be reasonably
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
works. But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
work based on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire whole,
and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

      Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on the
Library.

      In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of a storage
or distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
License. 

3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public License
instead of this License to a given copy of the Library. To do this, you must
alter all the notices that refer to this License, so that they refer to the
ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2, instead of to this License. (If
a newer version than version 2 of the ordinary GNU General Public License has
appeared, then you can specify that version instead if you wish.) Do not make
any other change in these notices.

Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for that copy, so
the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all subsequent copies and
derivative works made from that copy.

This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of the Library into
a program that is not a library.

4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or derivative of it,
under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1
and 2 above provided that you accompany it with the complete corresponding
machine-readable source code, which must be distributed under the terms of
Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange.

If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy from a
designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source code from
the same place satisfies the requirement to distribute the source code, even
though third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object
code.

5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the Library, but is
designed to work with the Library by being compiled or linked with it, is called
a "work that uses the Library". Such a work, in isolation, is not a derivative
work of the Library, and therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library creates an
executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it contains portions of
the Library), rather than a "work that uses the library". The executable is
therefore covered by this License. Section 6 states terms for distribution of
such executables.

When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file that is
part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a derivative work of
the Library even though the source code is not. Whether this is true is
especially significant if the work can be linked without the Library, or if the
work is itself a library. The threshold for this to be true is not precisely
defined by law.

If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data structure layouts
and accessors, and small macros and small inline functions (ten lines or less in
length), then the use of the object file is unrestricted, regardless of whether
it is legally a derivative work. (Executables containing this object code plus
portions of the Library will still fall under Section 6.)

Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may distribute the
object code for the work under the terms of Section 6. Any executables
containing that work also fall under Section 6, whether or not they are linked
directly with the Library itself.

6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or link a "work
that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a work containing portions of
the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your choice, provided that
the terms permit modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the Library is
used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by this License. You
must supply a copy of this License. If the work during execution displays
copyright notices, you must include the copyright notice for the Library among
them, as well as a reference directing the user to the copy of this License.
Also, you must do one of these things:

    * a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding machine-readable
source code for the Library including whatever changes were used in the work
(which must be distributed under Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an
executable linked with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work
that uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the user can
modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified executable containing
the modified Library. (It is understood that the user who changes the contents
of definitions files in the Library will not necessarily be able to recompile
the application to use the modified definitions.)
    * b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the Library. A
suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a copy of the library
already present on the user's computer system, rather than copying library
functions into the executable, and (2) will operate properly with a modified
version of the library, if the user installs one, as long as the modified
version is interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
    * c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at least three
years, to give the same user the materials specified in Subsection 6a, above,
for a charge no more than the cost of performing this distribution.
    * d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy from a
designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above specified materials
from the same place.
    * e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these materials or
that you have already sent this user a copy. 

For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the Library" must
include any data and utility programs needed for reproducing the executable from
it. However, as a special exception, the materials to be distributed need not
include anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary form)
with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system
on which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies the
executable.

It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license restrictions of
other proprietary libraries that do not normally accompany the operating system.
Such a contradiction means you cannot use both them and the Library together in
an executable that you distribute.

7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the Library
side-by-side in a single library together with other library facilities not
covered by this License, and distribute such a combined library, provided that
the separate distribution of the work based on the Library and of the other
library facilities is otherwise permitted, and provided that you do these two
things:

    * a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work based on
the Library, uncombined with any other library facilities. This must be
distributed under the terms of the Sections above.
    * b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact that part
of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining where to find the
accompanying uncombined form of the same work. 

8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library
except as expressly provided under this License. Any attempt otherwise to copy,
modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute the Library is void, and will
automatically terminate your rights under this License. However, parties who
have received copies, or rights, from you under this License will not have their
licenses terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Library
or its derivative works. These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
accept this License. Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Library (or any
work based on the Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do
so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying the
Library or works based on it.

10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the Library),
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library subject to these terms and
conditions. You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients'
exercise of the rights granted herein. You are not responsible for enforcing
compliance by third parties with this License.

11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
conditions of this License. If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Library at all.
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of
the Library by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you,
then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to refrain
entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply, and
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
distribution system which is implemented by public license practices. Many
people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
consequence of the rest of this License.

12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in certain
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original copyright
holder who places the Library under this License may add an explicit
geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded. In such
case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body of this
License.

13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
Lesser General Public License from time to time. Such new versions will be
similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address
new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number. If the Library specifies
a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later version",
you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of that version
or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation. If the
Library does not specify a license version number, you may choose any version
ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free programs
whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these, write to the author
to ask for permission. For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software
Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions
for this. Our decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free
status of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing and
reuse of software generally.

NO WARRANTY

15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE
LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW. EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED
IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS
IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT
NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU. SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL,
SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY
TO USE THE LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF
THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER
PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest possible use
to the public, we recommend making it free software that everyone can
redistribute and change. You can do so by permitting redistribution under these
terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the ordinary General Public License).

To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library. It is safest
to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the
exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line
and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

one line to give the library's name and an idea of what it does.
Copyright (C) year  name of author

modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of

You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if necessary. Here is
a sample; alter the names:

 *      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
 *      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
 *      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
 *      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
 *      as of the date such litigation is filed.
 *
 *   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
 *      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
 *      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
 *      meet the following conditions:

 *          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

 *          stating that You changed the files; and
 *
 *      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
 *          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
 *          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
 *          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
 *          the Derivative Works; and
 *
 *      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
 *          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
 *          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
 *          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
 *          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
 *          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
 *          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
 *          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
 *          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
 *          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
 *          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
 *          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
 *          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
 *          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
 *          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
 *          as modifying the License.
 *
 *      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
 *      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
 *      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
 *      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
 *      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
 *      the conditions stated in this License.
 *
 *   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
 *      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
 *      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
 *      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
 *      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
 *      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
 *      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
 *
 *   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
 *      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
 *      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
 *      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
 *
 *   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
 *      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
 *      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
 *      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
 *      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
 *      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
 *      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
 *      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
 *      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
 *
 *   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
 *      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
 *      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
 *      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
 *      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
 *      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
 *      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
 *      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
 *      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
 *      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
 *      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
 *
 *   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
 *      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
 *      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
 *      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
 *      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
 *      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
 *      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
 *      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
 *      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
 *      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
 *
 *   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
 *
 *   APPENDIX: How to apply the Apache License to your work.
 *
 *      To apply the Apache License to your work, attach the following
 *      boilerplate notice, with the fields enclosed by brackets "[]"

Provided that Recipient is in compliance with the terms of this License, Recipient may, so long as without derogation of any of SGI's rights in and to the Original Code, distribute the source code and/or executable version(s) of Covered Code under (1) this License; (2) a license identical to this License but for only such changes as are necessary in order to clarify Recipient's role as licensor of Modifications; and/or (3) a license of Recipient's choosing, containing terms different from this License, provided that the license terms include this Section 3 and Sections 4, 6, 7, 10, 12, and 13, which terms may not be modified or superseded by any other terms of such license. If Recipient elects to use any license other than this License, Recipient must make it absolutely clear that any of its terms which differ from this License are offered by Recipient alone, and not by SGI. It is emphasized that this License is a limited license, and, regardless of the license form employed by Recipient in accordance with this Section 3.2, Recipient may relicense only such rights, in Original Code and Modifications by SGI, as it has actually been granted by SGI in this License.
3.3.Indemnity. Recipient hereby agrees to indemnify SGI for any liability incurred by SGI as a result of any such alternative license terms Recipient offers.
4.Termination. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate automatically if Recipient breaches any term herein and fails to cure such breach within 30 days thereof. Any sublicense to the Covered Code that is properly granted shall survive any termination of this License, absent termination by the terms of such sublicense. Provisions that, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this License, shall survive.
5.No Trademark Or Other Rights. This License does not grant any rights to: (i) any software apart from the Covered Code, nor shall any other rights or licenses not expressly granted hereunder arise by implication, estoppel or otherwise with respect to the Covered Code; (ii) any trade name, trademark or service mark whatsoever, including without limitation any related right for purposes of endorsement or promotion of products derived from the Covered Code, without prior written permission of SGI; or (iii) any title to or ownership of the Original Code, which shall at all times remains with SGI. All rights in the Original Code not expressly granted under this License are reserved. 
6.Compliance with Laws; Non-Infringement. There are various worldwide laws, regulations, and executive orders applicable to dispositions of Covered Code, including without limitation export, re-export, and import control laws, regulations, and executive orders, of the U.S. government and other countries, and Recipient is reminded it is obliged to obey such laws, regulations, and executive orders. Recipient may not distribute Covered Code that (i) in any way infringes (directly or contributorily) any intellectual property rights of any kind of any other person or entity or (ii) breaches any representation or warranty, express, implied or statutory, to which, under any applicable law, it might be deemed to have been subject.
7.Claims of Infringement. If Recipient learns of any third party claim that any disposition of Covered Code and/or functionality wholly or partially infringes the third party's intellectual property rights, Recipient will promptly notify SGI of such claim.
8.Versions of the License. SGI may publish revised and/or new versions of the License from time to time, each with a distinguishing version number. Once Covered Code has been published under a particular version of the License, Recipient may, for the duration of the license, continue to use it under the terms of that version, or choose to use such Covered Code under the terms of any subsequent version published by SGI. Subject to the provisions of Sections 3 and 4 of this License, only SGI may modify the terms applicable to Covered Code created under this License.

SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THAT EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO RECIPIENT.
11.Indemnity. Recipient shall be solely responsible for damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its utilization of rights under this License.
