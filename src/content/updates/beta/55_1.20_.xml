 11.4 It is understood and agreed that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Licensee's breach of Sections 2.0 (Limited Licenses), 3.0 (Restrictions), 6.0 (Term and Termination), and/or 7.0 (Confidential Information) of this Agreement will cause Sun irreparable damage for which recovery of money damages would be inadequate, and that Sun will therefore be entitled to seek injunctive relief to protect Sun's rights under this  Agreement, without posting bond or other security, in addition to any and all other remedies available under this Agreement, at law, and in equity.
 11.5 Neither party may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other party, except that Sun may assign this Agreement to an affiliated company without such consent.
 11.6 If any term or provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid under any applicable statute or rule of law, such provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
 11.7 No modification to this Agreement will be binding, unless in writing and manually signed by an authorized representative of each party.
 11.8 This Agreement, constitutes the parties' entire agreement relating to its subject matter. It cancels and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous oral and written communications, proposals, conditions, representations and warranties and prevails over any conflicting or additional terms contained in any quote, purchase order, acknowledgment, or other communication between the parties relating to its subject matter during its term, including but not limited to terms of any Binary Code Licenses, Supplemental Terms, or other standard licenses accompanying the Technology.

3.4. Application of Additional Terms. You may not offer or 
impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form 
that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License 
or the recipients rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, 
and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or 
liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered 
Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, 
and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. 
You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, 
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You 
alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer 
and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial 
Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, 
indemnity or liability terms You offer.

modify this License. 

4.2. Effect of New Versions. You may always continue to use, 
distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available 
under the terms of the version of the License under which You 
originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial 
Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting 
it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any 
subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make 
the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of
 the License under which You originally received the Covered 
Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or

validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder 
prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You 
by any distributor) shall survive termination. 

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND 
UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), 
CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, 
ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, 
OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY

the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within 
the Original Software (except to the extent applicable 
law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdictions 
conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this 
License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts 
located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice

The parties agree that the Federal District Court for the Northern District of California shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute involving exclusively federal causes of action.  That court and the California state courts in Santa Clara County, California shall have exclusive jurisdiction over all other disputes. The parties hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction of those courts. Choice of law rules of any jurisdiction and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to the Agreement or any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement.
11.2 Licensee agrees that the Technology and technical data delivered under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export laws (including but not limited to the Export Administration Regulations ("EAR": 15  C.F.R. Parts 730-774)) and applicable trade laws of other countries.  Licensee agrees to strictly comply with all such laws and assumes responsibility to obtain licenses to export, re-export, or import as may be required. Unless authorized by United States export laws, Licensee agrees that (i)�no Technology or technical data or direct product therefrom is being or will be acquired for, shipment, transfer, or re-export, directly or indirectly, to: a) any country subject to U.S. Embargo or terrorist controls or b) a country and its nationals in Country Group D:1 as listed in Part 740 Supplement 1 of the EAR; (ii)  Licensee nor any party to whom Technology and technical data are transferred is not identified on any U.S. Government export exclusion lists; and (iii) Technology and technical data will not be used for nuclear, missile, chemical biological weaponry, or other weapons of mass destruction.

11.4 It is understood and agreed that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Licensee's breach of Sections 2.0 (Limited Licenses), 3.0 (Restrictions), 6.0 (Term and Termination), and/or 7.0 (Confidential Information) of this Agreement will cause Sun irreparable damage for which recovery of money damages would be inadequate, and that Sun will therefore be entitled to seek injunctive relief to protect Sun's rights under this  Agreement, without posting bond or other security, in addition to any and all other remedies available under this Agreement, at law, and in equity.
11.5 Neither party may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other party, except that Sun may assign this Agreement to an affiliated company without such consent.
11.6 If any term or provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid under any applicable statute or rule of law, such provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
11.7 No modification to this Agreement will be binding, unless in writing and manually signed by an authorized representative of each party.
11.8 This Agreement, constitutes the parties' entire agreement relating to its subject matter. It cancels and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous oral and written communications, proposals, conditions, representations and warranties and prevails over any conflicting or additional terms contained in any quote, purchase order, acknowledgment, or other communication between the parties relating to its subject matter during its term, including but not limited to terms of any Binary Code Licenses, Supplemental Terms, or other standard licenses accompanying the Technology.

 9.3 NEITHER Sun nor any of its licensors will be liable for any indirect, punitive, special, incidental or consequential damages in connection with or arising out of this Agreement (including loss of business, revenue, profits, goodwill, use, data, electronically transmitted communications or other economic advantage), however they arise, whether for breach of contract, breach of warranty or in tort, including negligence, and even if that party has previously been advised of the possibility of such damages AND WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DAMAGES ARE FORESEEABLE.  In no event will Sun's aggregate liability to Licensee for all claims under this Agreement, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount paid by Licensee for the Technology under this Agreement.
 9.4 Liability for damages will be limited and excluded as set forth above even if any exclusive remedy provided in this  Agreement fails of its essential purpose.  Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental or consequential damages, so some of the terms above may not be applicable to you.

 10 U.S. GOVERNMENT RIGHTS. 
The Technology is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), and may consist of "commercial computer software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. � 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995).

This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this Agreement.

 11 GENERAL.
 11.1 All disputes will be governed by California law and controlling U.S. federal law.  The venue for litigation will be the appropriate courts located in Santa Clara County, California. The parties agree that the Federal District Court for the Northern District of California shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute involving exclusively federal causes of action.  That court and the California state courts in Santa Clara County, California shall have exclusive jurisdiction over all other disputes. The parties hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction of those courts. Choice of law rules of any jurisdiction and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to the Agreement or any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement.
 11.2 Licensee agrees that the Technology and technical data delivered under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export laws (including but not limited to the Export Administration Regulations ("EAR": 15  C.F.R. Parts 730-774)) and applicable trade laws of other countries.  Licensee agrees to strictly comply with all such laws and assumes responsibility to obtain licenses to export, re-export, or import as may be required. Unless authorized by United States export laws, Licensee agrees that (i)�no Technology or technical data or direct product therefrom is being or will be acquired for, shipment, transfer, or re-export, directly or indirectly, to: a) any country subject to U.S. Embargo or terrorist controls or b) a country and its nationals in Country Group D:1 as listed in Part 740 Supplement 1 of the EAR; (ii)  Licensee nor any party to whom Technology and technical data are transferred is not identified on any U.S. Government export exclusion lists; and (iii) Technology and technical data will not be used for nuclear, missile, chemical biological weaponry, or other weapons of mass destruction. These obligations shall survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.
 11.3 Any express waiver or failure to exercise promptly any right under this Agreement will not create a continuing waiver or any expectation on non-enforcement.  To be enforceable, a waiver must be in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party.
 11.4 It is understood and agreed that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Licensee's breach of Sections 2.0 (Limited Licenses), 3.0 (Restrictions), 6.0 (Term and Termination), and/or 7.0 (Confidential Information) of this Agreement will cause Sun irreparable damage for which recovery of money damages would be inadequate, and that Sun will therefore be entitled to seek injunctive relief to protect Sun's rights under this  Agreement, without posting bond or other security, in addition to any and all other remedies available under this Agreement, at law, and in equity.
 11.5 Neither party may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other party, except that Sun may assign this Agreement to an affiliated company without such consent.
 11.6 If any term or provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid under any applicable statute or rule of law, such provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
 11.7 No modification to this Agreement will be binding, unless in writing and manually signed by an authorized representative of each party.
 11.8 This Agreement, constitutes the parties' entire agreement relating to its subject matter. It cancels and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous oral and written communications, proposals, conditions, representations and warranties and prevails over any conflicting or additional terms contained in any quote, purchase order, acknowledgment, or other communication between the parties relating to its subject matter during its term, including but not limited to terms of any Binary Code Licenses, Supplemental Terms, or other standard licenses accompanying the Technology.

    text giving attribution to any 
    Contributor or the Initial Developer.

    3.4. Application of Additional Terms.

    You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in

    of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions which, by their
    nature, must remain in effect beyond the termination of this 
    License shall survive.

    declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a 
    Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against 
    whom You assert such claim is referred to as "Participant") 
    alleging that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor 
    Version where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original
    Software where the Participant is the Initial Developer) 
    directly or indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all 
    rights granted directly or indirectly to You by such 
    Participant, the Initial Developer (if the Initial Developer 
    is not the Participant) and all Contributors under Sections 
    2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice

    alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly 
    infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by 
    license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent 
    infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses 
    granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall 
    be taken into account in determining the amount or value of 
    any payment or license.

      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

8 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
8.1 Licensee acknowledges that the Technology is not designed or intended for use in the design, construction, operation or maintenance of any nuclear facility.
8.2 THE TECHNOLOGY AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND.

Neither Sun nor its Licensors are under any obligation to release a commercial version of the Technology.
9.2 Licensee  acknowledges that  the Technology may not have been approved by the United States Federal Communications Commission, any other governmental agency, or any test laboratory (for example without limitation, Underwriter's Laboratories, and TUV).
9.3 NEITHER Sun nor any of its licensors will be liable for any indirect, punitive, special, incidental or consequential damages in connection with or arising out of this Agreement (including loss of business, revenue, profits, goodwill, use, data, electronically transmitted communications or other economic advantage), however they arise, whether for breach of contract, breach of warranty or in tort, including negligence, and even if that party has previously been advised of the possibility of such damages AND WHETHER OR NOT SUCH DAMAGES ARE FORESEEABLE.  In no event will Sun's aggregate liability to Licensee for all claims under this Agreement, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount paid by Licensee for the Technology under this Agreement.
9.4 Liability for damages will be limited and excluded as set forth above even if any exclusive remedy provided in this  Agreement fails of its essential purpose.  Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental or consequential damages, so some of the terms above may not be applicable to you.

10 U.S. GOVERNMENT RIGHTS. 
The Technology is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), and may consist of "commercial computer software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. � 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Technology with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this Agreement.

11 GENERAL.
11.1 All disputes will be governed by California law and controlling U.S. federal law.  The venue for litigation will be the appropriate courts located in Santa Clara County, California. The parties agree that the Federal District Court for the Northern District of California shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute involving exclusively federal causes of action.  That court and the California state courts in Santa Clara County, California shall have exclusive jurisdiction over all other disputes. The parties hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction of those courts. Choice of law rules of any jurisdiction and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to the Agreement or any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement.
11.2 Licensee agrees that the Technology and technical data delivered under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export laws (including but not limited to the Export Administration Regulations ("EAR": 15  C.F.R. Parts 730-774)) and applicable trade laws of other countries.  Licensee agrees to strictly comply with all such laws and assumes responsibility to obtain licenses to export, re-export, or import as may be required. Unless authorized by United States export laws, Licensee agrees that (i)�no Technology or technical data or direct product therefrom is being or will be acquired for, shipment, transfer, or re-export, directly or indirectly, to: a) any country subject to U.S. Embargo or terrorist controls or b) a country and its nationals in Country Group D:1 as listed in Part 740 Supplement 1 of the EAR; (ii)  Licensee nor any party to whom Technology and technical data are transferred is not identified on any U.S. Government export exclusion lists; and (iii) Technology and technical data will not be used for nuclear, missile, chemical biological weaponry, or other weapons of mass destruction. These obligations shall survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.
11.3 Any express waiver or failure to exercise promptly any right under this Agreement will not create a continuing waiver or any expectation on non-enforcement.  To be enforceable, a waiver must be in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party.
11.4 It is understood and agreed that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Licensee's breach of Sections 2.0 (Limited Licenses), 3.0 (Restrictions), 6.0 (Term and Termination), and/or 7.0 (Confidential Information) of this Agreement will cause Sun irreparable damage for which recovery of money damages would be inadequate, and that Sun will therefore be entitled to seek injunctive relief to protect Sun's rights under this  Agreement, without posting bond or other security, in addition to any and all other remedies available under this Agreement, at law, and in equity.
11.5 Neither party may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other party, except that Sun may assign this Agreement to an affiliated company without such consent.
11.6 If any term or provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid under any applicable statute or rule of law, such provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
11.7 No modification to this Agreement will be binding, unless in writing and manually signed by an authorized representative of each party.
11.8 This Agreement, constitutes the parties' entire agreement relating to its subject matter. It cancels and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous oral and written communications, proposals, conditions, representations and warranties and prevails over any conflicting or additional terms contained in any quote, purchase order, acknowledgment, or other communication between the parties relating to its subject matter during its term, including but not limited to terms of any Binary Code Licenses, Supplemental Terms, or other standard licenses accompanying the Technology.

      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
