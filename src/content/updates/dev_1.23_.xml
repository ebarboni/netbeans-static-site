      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

  Any Covered Software that You distribute or otherwise make
  available in Executable form must also be made available in Source
  Code form and that Source Code form must be distributed only under
  the terms of this License. You must include a copy of this License
  with every copy of the Source Code form of the Covered Software
  You distribute or otherwise make available. You must inform
  recipients of any such Covered Software in Executable form as to
  how they can obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a
  reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for
  software exchange.

  3.2. Modifications.

  The Modifications that You create or to which You contribute are

  believe Your Modifications are Your original creation(s) and/or
  You have sufficient rights to grant the rights conveyed by this
  License.

  3.3. Required Notices.

  You must include a notice in each of Your Modifications that
  identifies You as the Contributor of the Modification. You may not
  remove or alter any copyright, patent or trademark notices
  contained within the Covered Software, or any notices of licensing
  or any descriptive text giving attribution to any Contributor or
  the Initial Developer.

  3.4. Application of Additional Terms.

  You may not offer or impose any terms on any Covered Software in
  Source Code form that alters or restricts the applicable version
  of this License or the recipients' rights hereunder. You may
  choose to offer, and to charge a fee for, warranty, support,
  indemnity or liability obligations to one or more recipients of
  Covered Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf,
  and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. You
  must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, support,
  indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You alone, and You
  hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every
  Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or
  such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, indemnity or
  liability terms You offer.

  3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions.

  You may distribute the Executable form of the Covered Software

  Your choice, which may contain terms different from this License,
  provided that You are in compliance with the terms of this License
  and that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to
  limit or alter the recipient's rights in the Source Code form from
  the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute the
  Covered Software in Executable form under a different license, You
  must make it absolutely clear that any terms which differ from
  this License are offered by You alone, not by the Initial

  Initial Developer and every Contributor for any liability incurred
  by the Initial Developer or such Contributor as a result of any
  such terms You offer.

  3.6. Larger Works.

  other code not governed by the terms of this License and
  distribute the Larger Work as a single product. In such a case,
  You must make sure the requirements of this License are fulfilled
  for the Covered Software.

4. Versions of the License.

  4.1. New Versions.

  Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial license steward and may
  publish revised and/or new versions of this License from time to
  time. Each version will be given a distinguishing version number.
  Except as provided in Section 4.3, no one other than the license
  steward has the right to modify this License.

  4.2. Effect of New Versions.

  You may always continue to use, distribute or otherwise make the
  Covered Software available under the terms of the version of the
  License under which You originally received the Covered Software.
  If the Initial Developer includes a notice in the Original
  Software prohibiting it from being distributed or otherwise made
  available under any subsequent version of the License, You must
  distribute and make the Covered Software available under the terms
  of the version of the License under which You originally received
  the Covered Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use,
  distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available under
  the terms of any subsequent version of the License published by
  the license steward.

  4.3. Modified Versions.

  When You are an Initial Developer and You want to create a new
  license for Your Original Software, You may create and use a
  modified version of this License if You: (a) rename the license
  and remove any references to the name of the license steward
  (except to note that the license differs from this License); and
  (b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms which
  differ from this License.

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.

COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER THIS LICENSE ON AN `AS IS' BASIS,
WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE
IS FREE OF DEFECTS, MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR
NON-INFRINGING. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF
THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE
DEFECTIVE IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY
OTHER CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING,
REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES AN
ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED SOFTWARE IS
AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER.

6. TERMINATION.

  6.1. This License and the rights granted hereunder will terminate
  automatically if You fail to comply with terms herein and fail to
  cure such breach within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach.
  Provisions which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond
  the termination of this License shall survive.

  6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
  declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
  Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom You
  assert such claim is referred to as `Participant') alleging that
  the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version where
  the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software where
  the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly
  infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
  indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer (if
  the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all Contributors
  under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days
  notice from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically
  at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if within
  such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with respect to the
  Participant Software against such Participant either unilaterally
  or pursuant to a written agreement with Participant.

  6.3. If You assert a patent infringement claim against Participant
  alleging that the Participant Software directly or indirectly
  infringes any patent where such claim is resolved (such as by
  license or settlement) prior to the initiation of patent
  infringement litigation, then the reasonable value of the licenses
  granted by such Participant under Sections 2.1 or 2.2 shall be
  taken into account in determining the amount or value of any
  payment or license.

  6.4. In the event of termination under Sections 6.1 or 6.2 above,
  all end user licenses that have been validly granted by You or any
  distributor hereunder prior to termination (excluding licenses
  granted to You by any distributor) shall survive termination.

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.

UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT
(INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE
INITIAL DEVELOPER, ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF
COVERED SOFTWARE, OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE
TO ANY PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT
LIMITATION, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, COMPUTER
FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR
LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT
APPLY TO LIABILITY FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH
PARTY'S NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION OR
LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO THIS EXCLUSION
AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS.

The Covered Software is a `commercial item,' as that term is defined
in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), consisting of `commercial computer
software' (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. �
252.227-7014(a)(1)) and `commercial computer software documentation'
as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent
with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4
(June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered Software
with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights
clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other
clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer
software under this License.

9. MISCELLANEOUS.

This License represents the complete agreement concerning subject
matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent
necessary to make it enforceable. This License shall be governed by
the law of the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within
the Original Software (except to the extent applicable law, if any,
provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdiction's conflict-of-law
provisions. Any litigation relating to this License shall be subject
to the jurisdiction of the courts located in the jurisdiction and
venue specified in a notice contained within the Original Software,
with the losing party responsible for costs, including, without
limitation, court costs and reasonable attorneys' fees and expenses.
The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for
the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any law or
regulation which provides that the language of a contract shall be
construed against the drafter shall not apply to this License. You
agree that You alone are responsible for compliance with the United
States export administration regulations (and the export control
laws and regulation of any other countries) when You use, distribute
or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS.

As between Initial Developer and the Contributors, each party is
responsible for claims and damages arising, directly or indirectly,
out of its utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute such
responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein is intended or
shall be deemed to constitute any admission of liability.

NOTICE PURSUANT TO SECTION 9 OF THE COMMON DEVELOPMENT AND
DISTRIBUTION LICENSE (CDDL)

The code released under the CDDL shall be governed by the laws of
the State of California (excluding conflict-of-law provisions). Any
litigation relating to this License shall be subject to the
jurisdiction of the Federal Courts of the Northern District of
California and the state courts of the State of California, with
venue lying in Santa Clara County, California.

Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or

otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms

of any subsequent version of the License published by the

license steward.

against whom You assert such claim is referred to as

Participant) alleging that the Participant Software

(meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is

a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant

is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes

any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or

indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer

(if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all

Contributors under Sections

In no event will Sun's liability to you, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount paid by you for Software under this Agreement. The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its essential purpose.

original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to
grant the rights conveyed by this License.

the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright,
patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software,
or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving

3.4. Application of Additional Terms. You may not offer or
impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form
that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License
or the recipients rights hereunder. You may choose to offer,
and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or
liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered
Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf,
and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor.
You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty,
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You
alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer
and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial
Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support,
indemnity or liability terms You offer.

the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms
of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice,
which may contain terms different from this License, provided
that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and
that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to
limit or alter the recipients rights in the Source Code form
from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute
the Covered Software in Executable form under a different
license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms
which differ from this License are offered by You alone,
not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby
agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor
for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such
Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer.

modify this License.

4.2. Effect of New Versions. You may always continue to use,
distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available
under the terms of the version of the License under which You
originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial
Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting
it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any
subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make
the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of
 the License under which You originally received the Covered
Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or
otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms
of any subsequent version of the License published by the
license steward.

4.3. Modified Versions. When You are an Initial Developer and
You want to create a new license for Your Original Software,
You may create and use a modified version of this License if You:

which differ from this License.

comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach
within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions
which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the
termination of this License shall survive.

6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding
declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer
or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor
against whom You assert such claim is referred to as
Participant) alleging that the Participant Software
(meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is
a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant
is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes
any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or
indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer
(if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all
Contributors under Sections

2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice
from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically
at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if
within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with
respect to the Participant Software against such Participant
either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with
Participant.

6.3. In the event of termination under Sections

6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been

OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY
PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL
DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION,
DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE,
COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL
HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.
THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY
FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS
NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH
LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION
OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO
THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision
shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it
enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of
the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within

law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdictions
conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this
License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts
located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice
contained within the Original Software, with the losing
party responsible for costs, including, without limitation,
court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses.
The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts
for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded.
Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a
contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not

distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. As between Initial Developer
and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims
and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its
utilization of rights under this License and You agree to
