LICENSE AGREEMENT

REFACTORIT (TM)

Notice to User: This AQRIS software product (together with its accompanying 
documentation, the "PRODUCT") is the property of AQRIS SOFTWARE AS ("AQRIS"). 
The PRODUCT is made available to you, the original purchaser, subject to the 
following license agreement ("LICENSE").

Please read this LICENSE carefully before downloading, installing or using the
PRODUCT. A copy of this LICENSE is available for future reference in the
"refactorit.license" file or in the installation directory of PRODUCT.

If you DO NOT AGREE TO THE TERMS OF THIS LICENSE, then DO NOT DOWNLOAD, INSTALL 
OR USE THE PRODUCT ANY OTHER WAY. Any use of this PRODUCT by you constitutes 
your acceptance of these terms.

Since AQRIS provides a fully featured trial version of PRODUCT, there is a no 
returns and no refunds policy.

AQRIS is only willing to grant you this LICENSE if you obtained the PRODUCT 
from AQRIS or an AQRIS authorized reseller. If you obtained the PRODUCT from 
any other source you may not install or use the PRODUCT.

1. OWNERSHIP.
The PRODUCT is proprietary to AQRIS. The PRODUCT is licensed, not sold, to you 
notwithstanding any reference herein to "purchases." You acknowledge and agree 
that: 
(a) the PRODUCT is protected under international copyright laws and the 
copyright law of the Republic of Estonia; 
(b) AQRIS and its licensors retain all copyrights and other intellectual 
property rights in the PRODUCT; 
(c) there are no implied licenses under this LICENSE, and any rights not 
expressly granted to you hereunder are reserved by AQRIS; 
(d) you acquire no ownership or other interest (other than your license rights) 
in or to the PRODUCT; and 
(e) AQRIS owns all copies of the PRODUCT, however made. You agree that you will 
not, at any time, contest anywhere in the world AQRIS's ownership of the 
PRODUCT, nor will you challenge the validity of AQRIS's rights in the PRODUCT. 
You have no rights hereunder to use any trademark or service mark belonging to 
AQRIS.

2. GRANT OF LICENSE.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this LICENSE, AQRIS grants to you, if 
you are an individual, or, if you are an entity, one (1) designated person in 
your organization ("NAMED USER") a personal, nonexclusive, non-transferable and 
limited LICENSE to use the PRODUCT solely to analyze and refactor your own 
application programs and other works ("WORKS"). You may install the PRODUCT on 
a reasonable number of machines provided that the NAMED USER is the only 
individual permitted to use the PRODUCT. Subject to the other terms and 
conditions of this LICENSE, you may distribute your WORKS to others for 
production use. You may also make a reasonable number of copies of the PRODUCT 
to backup devices such as hard disks, optical media, or tape and one (1) 
physical CD media backup copy of the PRODUCT solely to replace the original 
copy provided to you if the original copy is damaged or destroyed. All rights 
not specifically granted to you herein are retained by AQRIS. You may purchase 
from AQRIS or its authorized reseller additional licenses to permit multiple 
NAMED USERS to use the PRODUCT (each, a "NAMED USER LICENSE"). Such rights will 
be effective only when granted in writing by AQRIS or its authorized reseller 
and are conditioned upon your payment of the applicable fees. If you purchase 
additional NAMED USER LICENSES for the PRODUCT then you are granted for each 
NAMED USER LICENSE the personal, nonexclusive, non-transferable and limited 
license to designate one individual in your organization as the NAMED USER and 
permit such NAMED USER to install and use the PRODUCT solely as permitted to 
NAMED USER above. In such case, the PRODUCT may be used exclusively by the 
specifically designated NAMED USERS, subject to all the terms and conditions of 
this LICENSE. You agree that you will not designate more NAMED USERS than the 
number of NAMED USER LICENSES that AQRIS or its authorized reseller has 
expressly granted to you and you will not allow the PRODUCT to be used by any 
individuals other than the NAMED USERS designated by you from time to time. You 
agree to maintain accurate records of the NAMED USER designated by you to use 
the PRODUCT under each NAMED USER LICENSE you hold.

3. SPECIAL LICENSE TERMS.
The following terms and conditions ("SPECIAL TERMS") are specific to certain 
editions, versions and components of the PRODUCT and are in addition to the 
provisions of Section 2. If any provision of the SPECIAL TERMS applicable to 
the PRODUCT conflicts with any other provision of this LICENSE, then the 
provision of the SPECIAL TERMS will supersede and control.

3.1 EVALUATION EDITION.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this LICENSE, you may exercise your 
rights under this license to use the PRODUCT and to create WORKS for the sole 
purpose of evaluating or demonstrating the PRODUCT. Your license is for a term 
of thirty (30) days from the date AQRIS generates your license key for the 
PRODUCT ("EVALUATION PERIOD").
You may not use the PRODUCT for any commercial, business, governmental or 
institutional purpose of any kind. At the end of the EVALUATION PERIOD, further 
use of the PRODUCT by you is prohibited without the purchase of a commercial 
license. If you do not purchase a license for the PRODUCT at the end of the 
EVALUATION PERIOD, you hereby agree to permanently remove or delete the PRODUCT 
from all computer systems on which it was installed and destroy any software 
and documentation received, and not to reinstall a new copy of the PRODUCT. If 
you desire to continue to use the PRODUCT following the EVALUATION PERIOD, you 
should contact AQRIS or an AQRIS authorized reseller to order commercial 
licenses to use the PRODUCT. IMPORTANT NOTICE: The PRODUCT contains a time-out 
feature that disables full operation after the expiration of the EVALUATION 
PERIOD. WORKS that you analyze and refactor during the EVALUATION PERIOD may 
but should not require the PRODUCT in order to run. Upon expiration of the 
EVALUATION PERIOD, those WORKS may no longer be analyzed or refactored. You 
should therefore take precautions to avoid any loss of data that might result.

3.2 OPENSOURCE COMMUNITY EDITION.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this LICENSE, you may exercise your 
rights under this license to use the PRODUCT and to create WORKS solely for 
Open Source projects that have an established, vital, and active community 
("OPEN SOURCES PROJECTS"). The list of accepted OPEN SOURCE PROJECTS for the 
OPENSOURCE COMMUNITY LICENSE is at the sole discretion of AQRIS. For inquiries 
contact opensource-community@refactorit.com.

3.3 FREEWARE EDITION.
Subject to the terms and conditions of this LICENSE, you may exercise your 
rights under this license to use the PRODUCT and to create WORKS solely for 
small projects with up to fifty (50) source files.

3.4 UPGRADES.
If you have purchased an upgrade version of the PRODUCT, it constitutes a 
single product with the copy of the PRODUCT that you upgraded. This means that, 
although you may have two sets of PRODUCT media, you still have only one 
license. Therefore, you may not transfer the original copy of the PRODUCT to 
any other party.

4. LIMITATIONS. 
You may not: (a) modify, adapt, alter, translate, or create derivative works of 
the PRODUCT or merge the PRODUCT with other software other than as described in 
the PRODUCT's accompanying documentation or as approved of in writing by AQRIS; 
(b) lease, rent or loan the PRODUCT to any third party; (c) sublicense, 
distribute or otherwise transfer the PRODUCT or any component thereof to any 
third party except as expressly authorized in this AGREEMENT; (d) reverse 
engineer, decompile, disassemble, or otherwise attempt to derive the source 
code of the PRODUCT; (e) remove, alter, or obscure any confidentiality or 
proprietary notices (including copyright and trademark notices) of AQRIS or its 
suppliers on the PRODUCT; (f) allow third parties to access or use the PRODUCT 
such as in a time-sharing arrangement or operate the PRODUCT as part of a 
service bureau or, except as expressly authorized under Sections 2 and 3, 
otherwise for the use or benefit of third parties; (g) reproduce or use the 
PRODUCT except as expressly authorized under Sections 2 and 3; or (h) disclose 
or publish performance benchmark results for the PRODUCT. The rights granted 
under this LICENSE apply only to this PRODUCT. 

5. DISCLAIMER.
The PRODUCT is provided "AS IS" and without warranty of any kind. AQRIS hereby 
excludes and disclaims all implied or statutory warranties, including any 
warranties of merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose, quality, 
non-infringement, title, results, efforts or quiet enjoyment. There is no 
warranty that the product will be error-free or will function without 
interruption. You assume the entire risk for the results obtained using the 
PRODUCT. To the extent that AQRIS may not disclaim any warranty as a matter of 
applicable law, the scope and duration of such warranty will be the minimum 
permitted under such law. Some states do not allow the exclusion of implied 
warranties, so the above exclusion may not apply to you. This limited warranty 
gives you specific legal rights, and you may also have other legal rights, 
which vary from state to state.

6. SERVICES; UPDATES; PRODUCT CHANGES. 
AQRIS is not required under this LICENSE to provide any training or consulting 
services to you. Such services can be purchased separately. If, pursuant to a 
separate support agreement or otherwise, AQRIS provides you with a new release, 
error correction, update, upgrade or other modification to the PRODUCT, such 
modification will be deemed part of the PRODUCT, and subject to the terms of 
this LICENSE, unless the modification is expressly provided subject to a 
separate license agreement. AQRIS reserves the right at any time not to release 
or to discontinue release of the PRODUCT and to alter prices, features, 
specifications, capabilities, functions, licensing terms, release dates, 
general availability or other characteristics of any future releases of the 
PRODUCT.

7. REGISTRATION.
You must register the PRODUCT with AQRIS as a condition to your rights to use 
the PRODUCT. You will be prompted to register PRODUCT at the time of your 
installation or first use of the PRODUCT, at which time you will be notified 
(or directed to online resources explaining) how registration information 
provided by you may be used and you will be afforded the opportunity to opt out 
of certain uses of such information.

8. CONFIDENTIALITY. 
You acknowledge that the PRODUCT in source code form remains a confidential 
trade secret of AQRIS. You agree to hold this information in confidence, not 
disclose it to any person, and not use it for any purpose other than the use 
and operation of the PRODUCT as permitted under this LICENSE.

9. MARKETING
You agree to be identified as a customer of AQRIS and you agree that AQRIS may 
refer to you by name, trade name and trademark, if applicable, and may briefly 
describe your business in AQRIS' marketing materials and web site. You hereby 
grant AQRIS a license to use your name and any of 
your trade names and trademarks solely in connection with the rights granted to 
AQRIS pursuant to this marketing section.

10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. 
In no event will AQRIS be liable to any party for any indirect, incidental, 
consequential, exemplary, special or punitive damages, including any loss of 
profit, revenue, business opportunity or data, arising from or relating to this 
LICENSE or the PRODUCT, whether in contract, in tort or otherwise, even if 
AQRIS knew, should have known or has been advised of the possibility of such 
damages. AQRIS'S total cumulative liability arising from or related to this 
LICENSE or the PRODUCT, whether in contract, in tort or otherwise, will not 
exceed the fees actually paid by you under this LICENSE. This section 10 will 
apply even if an exclusive remedy hereunder has failed of its essential 
purpose. Some states do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidential or 
consequential damages, so the above limitation or exclusion may not apply to 
you.

11. TERM AND TERMINATION.

11.1 TERM.
The term of this LICENSE will begin as of the date that you receive the PRODUCT 
and will remain in effect perpetually unless terminated under this Section 11.

11.2 TERMINATION FOR CONVENIENCE. 
You may terminate this LICENSE for any reason, or for no reason, by giving 
AQRIS five (5) days' written notice.


11.3 TERMINATION FOR CAUSE. 
AQRIS may terminate this LICENSE if you breach your obligations hereunder. 
AQRIS will effect such termination by giving you notice of termination, 
specifying therein the alleged breach. If your breach is curable, you will have 
a grace period of thirty (30) days after such notice is served to cure the 
breach described therein. If the breach is cured within the thirty (30) day 
grace period, then this LICENSE will remain in effect; otherwise, this LICENSE 
will automatically terminate upon the conclusion of the thirty (30) day grace 
period.

11.4 EFFECT OF TERMINATION. 
Upon the termination of this LICENSE for any reason the following terms shall 
apply: (a) all rights granted under this LICENSE will immediately terminate and 
you must stop all use of the PRODUCT; (b) you must return to AQRIS or destroy 
all copies of the PRODUCT provided to or made by you, and will, within ten (10) 
days after the effective date of termination, provide AQRIS with written 
certification that all such copies have been returned or destroyed; and (c) all 
provisions of this LICENSE with the exception of the licenses granted in 
Sections 2 and 3, will survive termination of this LICENSE for any reason.

12. GENERAL PROVISIONS.

12.1 GOVERNING LAW. This License will be governed by and construed in 
accordance with international copyright acts and treaties.

12.2 ENTIRE LICENSE; SEVERABILITY.
This LICENSE constitutes the entire, final and exclusive agreement between you 
and AQRIS regarding the specific license transaction described herein. If any 
provision of this LICENSE is held to be illegal, invalid or unenforceable for 
any reason, then such provision will be enforced to the maximum extent 
permissible and the remainder of the provisions of this LICENSE will remain in 
full force and effect.

12.3 ASSIGNMENT.
You may not transfer or assign this LICENSE or assign any of your rights or 
delegate any of your obligations under this LICENSE, by operation of law or 
otherwise (including by merger, sale of assets or consolidation), without 
AQRIS's prior written consent. Any attempted assignment in violation of this 
Section 12.3 will be void.

12.4 WAIVER AND MODIFICATIONS.
All waivers must be in writing. Any waiver or failure to enforce a provision of 
this LICENSE on one occasion shall not be deemed a waiver of any other 
provision or such provision on any other occasion. This LICENSE may only be 
amended by a written document signed by both parties. If you have any questions 
about this LICENSE, please contact AQRIS.
