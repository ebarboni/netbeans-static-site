service that is the direct product of the
SOFTWARE PRODUCT (the foregoing collectively
referred to as the "Restricted Components"), to
any country, person, entity or end user subject
to U.S. export restrictions. You specifically
agree not to export or re-export any of the
Restricted Components (i) to any country to which
the U.S. has embargoed or restricted the export
of goods or services, which currently include,
but are not necessarily limited to Cuba, Iran,

participating in U.S. export transactions by any
federal agency of the U.S. government. (iv) To

that you are not located in, under control of, or
a national or resident of any such country or on
any such list. You warrant and represent that
neither the BXA nor any other U.S. federal agency
has suspended, revoked, or denied your export
privileges.


8. INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY INDEMNIFICATION.

8.1. Defense.  If a third party claims that your
Development or Production use of the Software in
accordance with the terms of this Agreement and
any associated Documentation infringes any United
States copyright or patent, you must promptly
notify InsiTech in writing.  InsiTech will defend
you against such claim if you fully cooperate
with InsiTech and allow InsiTech to control the
defense and all related settlement negotiations,
and then InsiTech will indemnify you from and
against any damages finally awarded for such
infringement.

8.2. Injunctive Relief.  If an injunction is
sought or obtained against your use of the
Software as a result of a third party
infringement claim, InsiTech may, at its sole
option and expense, (i) procure for you the right
to continue using the affected Software, (ii)
replace or modify the affected Software with
functionally substantially equivalent software so
that it does not infringe, or, if either (i) of
(ii) is not commercially feasible, (iii)
terminate the licenses and refund the license
fees received for the affected Software on a pro
rata basis using a thirty six (36) month
amortization schedule.

8.3. Disclaimer of Liability.  InsiTech shall
have no liability for any third party claim of
infringement based upon (i) use of other than the
then current, unaltered version of the applicable
Software, unless the infringing portion is also
in the then current, unaltered release; (ii) use,
operation or combination of the applicable
Software with non-InsiTech programs, data,
equipment or Documentation if such infringement
would have been avoided but for such use,
operation or combination; (iii) any third party
software, or (iv) any rights arising under the
laws of any jurisdiction outside the USA.  The
foregoing constitutes the entire liability of
InsiTech, and your sole and exclusive remedy with
respect to any third party claims of
infringement.


9. LIMITATIONS ON WARRANTY

9.1. Licensee acknowledges that Software may
contain errors and is not designed or intended
for use in the design, construction, operation or
maintenance of any nuclear facility or other high
risk or hazardous environments ("High Risk
Activities"). InsiTech disclaims any express or
implied warranty of fitness for such uses.
Licensee represents and warrants to InsiTech that
it will not use, distribute or license the
Licensed Software for High Risk Activities.
SUBJECT TO THE FOREGOING EXPRESS WARRANTY AS TO
THE SOFTWARE PROVIDED, IT IS PROVIDED "AS IS".
ALL IMPLIED CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND
WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF
MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS
FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR NON-INFRINGEMENT,
ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT SUCH
DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE LEGALLY INVALID.

9.2. Limited Warranty.  Except with respect to
the Sample Code, which is provided "as is,"
without warranty of any kind, InsiTech hereby
warrants that (i) the Software shall in the form
delivered conform in all material respects to the
specifications therefore contained in the
applicable Documentation for it for a period of
ninety (90) days from date of receipt, and (ii)
any Support Services provided by InsiTech shall
be substantially as described in applicable
written materials provided to you by InsiTech,
and InsiTech support engineers will make
commercially reasonable efforts to solve any
problem. To the extent allowed by applicable law,
implied warranties on the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, if
any, are limited to ninety (90) days. Some
states/jurisdictions do not allow limitations on
duration of an implied warranty, so the above
limitation may not apply to you.

9.3. CUSTOMER REMEDIES. InsiTech's entire
liability and your exclusive remedy shall be, at
InsiTech's option, either (a) return of the price
paid, if any, or (b) repair or replacement of the
SOFTWARE PRODUCT that does not meet InsiTech's
Limited Warranty and that is returned to InsiTech
with a copy of your receipt. This Limited
Warranty is void if failure of the SOFTWARE
PRODUCT has resulted from accident, abuse, or
misapplication. Any replacement SOFTWARE PRODUCT
will be warranted for the remainder of the
original warranty period or thirty (30) days,
whichever is longer. Outside the United States,
neither these remedies nor any product support
services offered by InsiTech are available
without proof of purchase.

9.4. Disclaimer.  THE FOREGOING WARRANTY IS
EXCLUSIVE AND IN LIEU OF ALL OTHER WARRANTIES,
EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, NCLUDING WARRANTIES OF
NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR
A PARTICULAR PURPOSE. THIS LIMITED WARRANTY GIVES
YOU SPECIFIC LEGAL RIGHTS. YOU MAY HAVE OTHERS,
WHICH VARY FROM STATE/JURISDICTION TO
STATE/JURISDICTION.


10. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY

10.1. DEVELOPMENT and PRODUCTION USE.  With
respect to DEVELOPMENT USE and PRODUCTION USE,
InsiTech's aggregate liability to you for damages

SOFTWARE PRODUCT and InsiTech or in any way
related to this Agreement, and regardless of
whether the claim for such damages is based in
contract, tort, strict liability of otherwise,

InsiTech for the affected SOFTWARE PRODUCT for
the twelve (12) month period immediately
preceding the events giving rise to such
liability.  In no event shall InsiTech be liable
for any indirect, incidental, special, punitive
or consequential damages, lost data or lost
profits, even if InsiTech has been advised as to
the possibility of such damages.

10.2. Applicability.  Some States do not permit
disclaimers of certain warranties or limitations
on certain types of liability under certain
circumstances; consequently, some of the
foregoing disclaimers and limitations may not be
applicable to you, in whole or in part.


11. SOFTWARE CHANGES.

11.1. Subject to its obligations under any
separate support/maintenance agreements, InsiTech
reserves the right at any time not to release or

licensing terms, release dates, general
availability or other characteristics of the
SOFTWARE PRODUCT, without prior notice.

liable for any delay or failure in performance
due to causes beyond its reasonable control,

under this Agreement, except to a successor in
interest as the result of a merger or acquisition

shall remain liable following any such merger,
sale or other transaction for all obligations
arising under this Agreement before or after such
transaction, unless otherwise agreed in writing
by InsiTech.  InsiTech may charge a transfer fee
in connection with any such transaction.

12.3. Severability.  If any part of this
Agreement is held to be unenforceable, in whole
or in part, such holding will not affect the
validity of the other parts of the Agreement.

provision of this Agreement must be in writing,
signed by the waiving party, and will not operate
or be interpreted as a waiver of any other or
subsequent breach.

will be governed by both the substantive and
procedural laws of Connecticut, U.S.A., excluding
its conflict of law rules.  Any dispute regarding
this Agreement will be heard in the state or

Cheshire, Connecticut, U.S.A. and you agree that
you shall be subject to the personal jurisdiction
of such courts, and that legal process from any
such court may effectively be served upon you by

bear its own costs in any such proceeding, and
each party hereby waives the right to trial by

modification to this Agreement must be in writing
signed by both parties.  This Agreement

to such terms, provisions or conditions.

12.7. Acceptance.  The earlier of your (i) downloading
of the SOFTWARE PRODUCT, (ii) use of the
SOFTWARE PRODUCT or (iii) receipt by InsiTech of a
