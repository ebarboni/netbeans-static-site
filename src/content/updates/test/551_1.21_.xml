In no event will Sun's liability to you, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount paid by you for Software under this Agreement. The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its essential purpose.

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this Agreement will remain in effect with the provision omitted, unless omission would frustrate the intent of the parties, in which case this Agreement will immediately terminate.

13. Integration. 

This Agreement is the entire agreement between you and Sun relating to its subject matter. It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals, representations and warranties and prevails over any conflicting or additional terms of any quote, order, acknowledgment, or other communication between the parties relating to its subject matter during the term of this Agreement.

the copyright notice that applies to the Original Work.

4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names
of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or
service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this
Original Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing
in this License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights,
patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as
expressly stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or
offer to sell embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims
defined in Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if
such marks are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be
interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this
License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to
license.

5) This section intentionally omitted.

6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative
Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the
Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any
descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause
the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent
Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have
modified the Original Work.

7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that
the copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein
by Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms
of this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights
and patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding
sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS
and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU.
This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No
license to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.

8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory,
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the
Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License
or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss
of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not
apply to liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's
negligence to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some
jurisdictions do not allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or
consequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or
a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to
obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing
else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You)
grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work
or to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt
to do so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement
between Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the
equivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by
exercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate
Your acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.

10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically
and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License
as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim,
against Licensor or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a
patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging
patent infringement by combinations of the Original Work with other software or
hardware.

11) Jurisdiction, Venue and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this
License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the
Licensor resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under
the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The
application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International
Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the
scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the
requirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. ÃÂ§ 101 et
seq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international treaty. This
section shall survive the termination of this License.

12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or
seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including
any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this
License.

13) Miscellaneous. This License represents the complete agreement concerning
the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this License is held to be
unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to
make it enforceable.

14) Definition of "You" in This License. "You" throughout this License, whether
in upper or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights
under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal
entities, "You" includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is
under common control with you. For purposes of this definition, "control" means
(i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such
entity, whether by contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent
(50%) or more of the outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such
entity.

15) Right to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise
restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not
to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You.

Academic Free License v. 2.1
============================

Copyright (c) 2005 Bob Ippolito.  All rights reserved.

This Academic Free License (the "License") applies to any original work of
authorship (the "Original Work") whose owner (the "Licensor") has placed the
following notice immediately following the copyright notice for the Original
Work:

Licensed under the Academic Free License version 2.1

1) Grant of Copyright License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license to do the
following:

a) to reproduce the Original Work in copies;

b) to prepare derivative works ("Derivative Works") based upon the Original
Work;

c) to distribute copies of the Original Work and Derivative Works to the public;

d) to perform the Original Work publicly; and

e) to display the Original Work publicly.

2) Grant of Patent License. Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,
royalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual, sublicenseable license, under patent
claims owned or controlled by the Licensor that are embodied in the Original
Work as furnished by the Licensor, to make, use, sell and offer for sale the
Original Work and Derivative Works.

3) Grant of Source Code License. The term "Source Code" means the preferred form
of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available
documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. Licensor hereby agrees
to provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code of the Original Work along
with each copy of the Original Work that Licensor distributes. Licensor reserves
the right to satisfy this obligation by placing a machine-readable copy of the
Source Code in an information repository reasonably calculated to permit
inexpensive and convenient access by You for as long as Licensor continues to
distribute the Original Work, and by publishing the address of that information
repository in a notice immediately following the copyright notice that applies
to the Original Work.

4) Exclusions From License Grant. Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names
of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service
marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original
Work without express prior written permission of the Licensor. Nothing in this
License shall be deemed to grant any rights to trademarks, copyrights, patents,
trade secrets or any other intellectual property of Licensor except as expressly
stated herein. No patent license is granted to make, use, sell or offer to sell
embodiments of any patent claims other than the licensed claims defined in
Section 2. No right is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such marks
are included in the Original Work. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted
to prohibit Licensor from licensing under different terms from this License any
Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license.

5) This section intentionally omitted.

6) Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative
Works that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the
Source Code of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any
descriptive text identified therein as an "Attribution Notice." You must cause
the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent
Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have
modified the Original Work.

7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor warrants that the
copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights granted herein by
Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You under the terms of
this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of those copyrights and
patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately proceeding
sentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an "AS IS" BASIS
and WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without limitation,
the warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK IS WITH YOU.
This DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this License. No
license to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.

8) Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory,
whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the
Licensor be liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental,
or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or
the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of
goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other
commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to
liability for death or personal injury resulting from Licensor's negligence to
the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. Some jurisdictions do not
allow the exclusion or limitation of incidental or consequential damages, so
this exclusion and limitation may not apply to You.

9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies of the Original Work or
a Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort under the circumstances to
obtain the express assent of recipients to the terms of this License. Nothing
else but this License (or another written agreement between Licensor and You)
grants You permission to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work or
to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1 herein, and any attempt to do
so except under the terms of this License (or another written agreement between
Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright law, the equivalent
laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore, by exercising
any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate Your
acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.

10) Termination for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically

as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim,

resides or in which Licensor conducts its primary business, and under the laws
of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application
of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of

this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and
penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act, 17 U.S.C. Â§ 101 et seq., the equivalent
laws of other countries, and international treaty. This section shall survive
the termination of this License.

12) Attorneys Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or
seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to
recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable
attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any
appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this
License.

Modifications made by that Contributor. 

3. Distribution Obligations. 

3.1. Availability of Source Code. Any Covered Software that You 
distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form must 
also be made available in Source Code form and that Source Code 
form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. 
You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the 
Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or 
otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any 
such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can 
obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a 
reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for 
software exchange. 

3.2. Modifications. The Modifications that You create or to 
which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License. 
You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your 
original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to 
grant the rights conveyed by this License. 

3.3. Required Notices. You must include a notice in each of 
Your Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of 
the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, 
patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, 
or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving 
attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer. 

3.4. Application of Additional Terms. You may not offer or 
impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form 
that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License 
or the recipients rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, 
and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or 
liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered 
Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, 
and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. 
You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, 
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You 
alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer 
and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial 
Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, 
indemnity or liability terms You offer.

3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute 
the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms 
of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, 
which may contain terms different from this License, provided 
that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and 
that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to 
limit or alter the recipients rights in the Source Code form 
from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute 
the Covered Software in Executable form under a different 
license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms 
which differ from this License are offered by You alone, 
not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby 
agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor 
for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such 
Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. 

3.6. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining 
Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms of 
this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. 
In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this 
License are fulfilled for the Covered Software. 

4. Versions of the License. 

4.1. New Versions. Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial 
license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions 
of this License from time to time. Each version will be given 
a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 

4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to 
modify this License. 

4.2. Effect of New Versions. You may always continue to use, 
distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available 
under the terms of the version of the License under which You 
originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial 
Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting 
it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any 
subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make 
the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of
 the License under which You originally received the Covered 
Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or 
otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms 
of any subsequent version of the License published by the 
license steward. 

4.3. Modified Versions. When You are an Initial Developer and 
You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, 
You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: 
(a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of 
the license steward (except to note that the license differs 
from this License); and 
(b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms 
which differ from this License. 

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER 
THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, 
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, 
WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, 
MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. 
THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED 
SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE 
IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER 
CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, 
REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES 
AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED 
SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 

6. TERMINATION. 

6.1. This License and the rights granted 
hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to 
comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach 
within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions 
which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the 
termination of this License shall survive. 

6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding 
declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer 
or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor 
against whom You assert such claim is referred to as 
Participant) alleging that the Participant Software 
(meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is 
a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant 
is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes 
any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or 
indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer 
(if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all 
Contributors under Sections 

2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice 
from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically 
at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if 
within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with 
respect to the Participant Software against such Participant 
either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with 
Participant. 

6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 

6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been 
validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder 
prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You 
by any distributor) shall survive termination. 

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND 
UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), 
CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, 
ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, 
OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY

DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, 
COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER 
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL 
HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY 
FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS 
NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH 
LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION 
OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO 
THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision 
of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision 
shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it 
enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of 
the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within

rights under this Agreement will terminate immediately without notice 
from Sun if you materially breach it or take any action in derogation of 
Sun's and/or its licensors' rights to Software. Sun may terminate this 
Agreement should any Software become, or in Sun's reasonable opinion 
likely to become, the subject of a claim of intellectual property 
infringement or trade secret misappropriation. Upon termination, you 
will cease use of, and destroy, Software and confirm compliance in 
writing to Sun. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 9-15 will survive termination 
of the Agreement.

7.	Java Compatibility and Open Source.

Software may contain Java technology. You may not create additional 
classes to, or modifications of, the Java technology, except under 
compatibility requirements available under a separate agreement 
available at www.java.net.

Sun supports and benefits from the global community of open source 
developers, and thanks the community for its important contributions and 
open standards-based technology, which Sun has adopted into many of its 
products.

Please note that portions of Software may be provided with notices and 
open source licenses from such communities and third parties that govern 
the use of those portions, and any licenses granted hereunder do not 
alter any rights and obligations you may have under such open source 
licenses, however, the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of 
liability provisions in this Agreement will apply to all Software in 
this distribution.

8. 	Limited Warranty.

Sun warrants to you that for a period of 90 days from the date of 
purchase, as evidenced by a copy of the receipt, the media on which 
Software is furnished (if any) will be free of defects in materials and 
workmanship under normal use. Except for the foregoing, Software is 
provided "AS IS". Your exclusive remedy and Sun's entire liability under 
this limited warranty will be at Sun's option to replace Software media 
or refund the fee paid for Software. Some states do not allow 
limitations on certain implied warranties, so the above may not apply to 
you. This limited warranty gives you specific legal rights. You may have 
others, which vary from state to state.

9.	Disclaimer of Warranty.

UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF 
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT 
ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO 
BE LEGALLY INVALID.

10. 	Limitation of Liability.

TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS 
LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR 
SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, 
HOWEVER CAUSED REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR 
RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN 
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. In no event will Sun's 
liability to you, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or 
otherwise, exceed the amount paid by you for Software under this 
Agreement. The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated 
warranty fails of its essential purpose. Some states do not allow the 
exclusion of incidental or consequential damages, so some of the terms 
above may not be applicable to you.

11. 	Export Regulations.

delivered under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export control laws 
and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries.

then the Government's rights in Software and accompanying documentation 
will be only as set forth in this Agreement; this is in accordance with 
48 CFR 227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense (DOD)
