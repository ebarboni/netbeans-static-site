      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You

          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this

The parties agree that the Federal District Court for the Northern District of California shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute involving exclusively federal causes of action.  That court and the California state courts in Santa Clara County, California shall have exclusive jurisdiction over all other disputes. The parties hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction of those courts. Choice of law rules of any jurisdiction and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to the Agreement or any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement.
11.2 Licensee agrees that the Technology and technical data delivered under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export laws (including but not limited to the Export Administration Regulations ("EAR": 15  C.F.R. Parts 730-774)) and applicable trade laws of other countries.  Licensee agrees to strictly comply with all such laws and assumes responsibility to obtain licenses to export, re-export, or import as may be required. Unless authorized by United States export laws, Licensee agrees that (i)�no Technology or technical data or direct product therefrom is being or will be acquired for, shipment, transfer, or re-export, directly or indirectly, to: a) any country subject to U.S. Embargo or terrorist controls or b) a country and its nationals in Country Group D:1 as listed in Part 740 Supplement 1 of the EAR; (ii)  Licensee nor any party to whom Technology and technical data are transferred is not identified on any U.S. Government export exclusion lists; and (iii) Technology and technical data will not be used for nuclear, missile, chemical biological weaponry, or other weapons of mass destruction. These obligations shall survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.

11.4 It is understood and agreed that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Licensee's breach of Sections 2.0 (Limited Licenses), 3.0 (Restrictions), 6.0 (Term and Termination), and/or 7.0 (Confidential Information) of this Agreement will cause Sun irreparable damage for which recovery of money damages would be inadequate, and that Sun will therefore be entitled to seek injunctive relief to protect Sun's rights under this  Agreement, without posting bond or other security, in addition to any and all other remedies available under this Agreement, at law, and in equity.
11.5 Neither party may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other party, except that Sun may assign this Agreement to an affiliated company without such consent.
11.6 If any term or provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid under any applicable statute or rule of law, such provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.

3. Distribution Obligations. 

3.1. Availability of Source Code. Any Covered Software that You 
distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form must 
also be made available in Source Code form and that Source Code 
form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. 
You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the 
Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or 
otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any 
such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can 
obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a 
reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for 
software exchange. 

3.2. Modifications. The Modifications that You create or to 
which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License. 
You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your 
original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to 
grant the rights conveyed by this License. 

3.3. Required Notices. You must include a notice in each of 
Your Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of 
the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, 
patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, 
or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving 
attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer. 

3.4. Application of Additional Terms. You may not offer or 
impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form 
that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License 
or the recipients rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, 
and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or 
liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered 
Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, 
and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. 
You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, 
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You 
alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer 
and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial 
Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, 
indemnity or liability terms You offer.

3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute 
the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms 
of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, 
which may contain terms different from this License, provided 
that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and 
that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to 
limit or alter the recipients rights in the Source Code form 
from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute 
the Covered Software in Executable form under a different 
license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms 
which differ from this License are offered by You alone, 
not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby 
agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor 
for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such 
Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. 

3.6. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining 
Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms of 
this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. 
In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this 
License are fulfilled for the Covered Software. 

4. Versions of the License. 

4.1. New Versions. Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial 
license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions 
of this License from time to time. Each version will be given 
a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 

4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to 
modify this License. 

4.2. Effect of New Versions. You may always continue to use, 
distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available 
under the terms of the version of the License under which You 
originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial 
Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting 
it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any 
subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make 
the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of
 the License under which You originally received the Covered 
Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or 
otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms 
of any subsequent version of the License published by the 
license steward. 

4.3. Modified Versions. When You are an Initial Developer and 
You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, 
You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: 
(a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of 
the license steward (except to note that the license differs 
from this License); and 
(b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms 
which differ from this License. 

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER 
THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, 
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, 
WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, 
MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. 
THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED 
SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE 
IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER 
CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, 
REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES 
AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED 
SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 

6. TERMINATION. 

6.1. This License and the rights granted 
hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to 
comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach 
within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions 
which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the 
termination of this License shall survive. 

6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding 
declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer 
or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor 
against whom You assert such claim is referred to as 
Participant) alleging that the Participant Software 
(meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is 
a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant 
is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes 
any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or 
indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer 
(if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all 
Contributors under Sections 

2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice 
from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically 
at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if 
within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with 
respect to the Participant Software against such Participant 
either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with 
Participant. 

6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 

6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been 
validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder 
prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You 
by any distributor) shall survive termination. 

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND 
UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), 
CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, 
ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, 
OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY 
PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, 
DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, 
COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER 
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL 
HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY 
FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS 
NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH 
LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION 
OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO 
THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. The Covered Software is a 
commercial item, as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 
(Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer software 
(as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 252.227-7014(a)(1)) 
and commercial computer software documentation as such terms 
are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 
48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 
(June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered 
Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. 
Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any 
other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses 
Government rights in computer software under this License. 

9. MISCELLANEOUS. This License represents the complete 
agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision 
of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision 
shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it 
enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of 
the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within 
the Original Software (except to the extent applicable 
law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdictions 
conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this 
License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts 
located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice 
contained within the Original Software, with the losing 
party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, 
court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. 
The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts 
for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. 
Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a 
contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not 
apply to this License. You agree that You alone are 
responsible for compliance with the United States export 
administration regulations (and the export control laws 
and regulation of any other countries) when You use, 
distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. As between Initial Developer 
and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims 
and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its 
utilization of rights under this License and You agree to 
work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute 
such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein 
is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission 
of liability.

          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided

      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,

      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

 8 DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY.
 8.1 Licensee acknowledges that the Technology is not designed or intended for use in the design, construction, operation or maintenance of any nuclear facility.
 8.2 THE TECHNOLOGY AND CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION ARE PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND. ALL EXPRESS AND IMPLIED CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS, AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF  MERCHANTABILITY, SATISFACTORY QUALITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR ANY WARRANTY OF NON-INFRINGEMENT, ARE DISCLAIMED, TO THE FULLEST EXTENT PERMITTED BY LAW.

 9 LIMITATION OF LIABILITY.
 9.1 Licensee acknowledges that the Technology may be experimental. Licensee further acknowledges that the Technology may have defects or deficiencies that cannot or will not be corrected by Sun. Licensee will indemnify and hold Sun harmless from any claims based on Licensee's use of the Technology for any purpose, and from any claims that later Updates furnished to Licensee are incompatible with the Technology provided to Licensee under this Agreement. Neither Sun nor its Licensors are under any obligation to release a commercial version of the Technology.
 9.2 Licensee  acknowledges that  the Technology may not have been approved by the United States Federal Communications Commission, any other governmental agency, or any test laboratory (for example without limitation, Underwriter's Laboratories, and TUV).

In no event will Sun's aggregate liability to Licensee for all claims under this Agreement, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount paid by Licensee for the Technology under this Agreement.
 9.4 Liability for damages will be limited and excluded as set forth above even if any exclusive remedy provided in this  Agreement fails of its essential purpose.  Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental or consequential damages, so some of the terms above may not be applicable to you.

 10 U.S. GOVERNMENT RIGHTS. 
The Technology is a "commercial item," as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 (Oct. 1995), and may consist of "commercial computer software" (as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. � 252.227-7014(a)(1)) and "commercial computer software documentation" as such terms are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 (June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Technology with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses Government rights in computer software under this Agreement.

 11 GENERAL.
 11.1 All disputes will be governed by California law and controlling U.S. federal law.  The venue for litigation will be the appropriate courts located in Santa Clara County, California. The parties agree that the Federal District Court for the Northern District of California shall have exclusive jurisdiction over any dispute involving exclusively federal causes of action.  That court and the California state courts in Santa Clara County, California shall have exclusive jurisdiction over all other disputes. The parties hereby submit to the personal jurisdiction of those courts. Choice of law rules of any jurisdiction and the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods will not apply to the Agreement or any dispute arising out of or related to this Agreement.
 11.2 Licensee agrees that the Technology and technical data delivered under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export laws (including but not limited to the Export Administration Regulations ("EAR": 15  C.F.R. Parts 730-774)) and applicable trade laws of other countries.  Licensee agrees to strictly comply with all such laws and assumes responsibility to obtain licenses to export, re-export, or import as may be required. Unless authorized by United States export laws, Licensee agrees that (i)�no Technology or technical data or direct product therefrom is being or will be acquired for, shipment, transfer, or re-export, directly or indirectly, to: a) any country subject to U.S. Embargo or terrorist controls or b) a country and its nationals in Country Group D:1 as listed in Part 740 Supplement 1 of the EAR; (ii)  Licensee nor any party to whom Technology and technical data are transferred is not identified on any U.S. Government export exclusion lists; and (iii) Technology and technical data will not be used for nuclear, missile, chemical biological weaponry, or other weapons of mass destruction. These obligations shall survive expiration or termination of this Agreement.
 11.3 Any express waiver or failure to exercise promptly any right under this Agreement will not create a continuing waiver or any expectation on non-enforcement.  To be enforceable, a waiver must be in writing and signed by an authorized representative of the waiving party.
 11.4 It is understood and agreed that, notwithstanding any other provision of this Agreement, Licensee's breach of Sections 2.0 (Limited Licenses), 3.0 (Restrictions), 6.0 (Term and Termination), and/or 7.0 (Confidential Information) of this Agreement will cause Sun irreparable damage for which recovery of money damages would be inadequate, and that Sun will therefore be entitled to seek injunctive relief to protect Sun's rights under this  Agreement, without posting bond or other security, in addition to any and all other remedies available under this Agreement, at law, and in equity.
 11.5 Neither party may assign or otherwise transfer any of its rights or obligations under this Agreement (whether by operation of law or otherwise), without the prior written consent of the other party, except that Sun may assign this Agreement to an affiliated company without such consent.
 11.6 If any term or provision of this Agreement is found to be invalid under any applicable statute or rule of law, such provision shall be enforced to the maximum extent permissible to effect the intent of the parties, and the remainder of this Agreement shall continue in full force and effect.
 11.7 No modification to this Agreement will be binding, unless in writing and manually signed by an authorized representative of each party.
 11.8 This Agreement, constitutes the parties' entire agreement relating to its subject matter. It cancels and supersedes all prior and contemporaneous oral and written communications, proposals, conditions, representations and warranties and prevails over any conflicting or additional terms contained in any quote, purchase order, acknowledgment, or other communication between the parties relating to its subject matter during its term, including but not limited to terms of any Binary Code Licenses, Supplemental Terms, or other standard licenses accompanying the Technology.

THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, 

EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, 

WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, 

MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. 

THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED 

SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE 

IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER 

CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, 

REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES 

AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED 

SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 



6. TERMINATION. 



6.1. This License and the rights granted 

hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to

which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the 

termination of this License shall survive. 



6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding 

declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer 

or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor 

against whom You assert such claim is referred to as 

Participant) alleging that the Participant Software 

(meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is 

a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant 

is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes 

any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or 

indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer 

(if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all 

Contributors under Sections 



2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice 

from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically 

at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if 

within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with 

respect to the Participant Software against such Participant 

either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with 

Participant. 



6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 



6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been 

validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder 

prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You 

by any distributor) shall survive termination. 



7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND 

UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), 

CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, 

ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, 

OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY 

PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL 

DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, 

DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, 

COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER 

COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL 

HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 

THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY 

FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS 

NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH 

LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION 

OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO 

THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.

Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any 

other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses 

Government rights in computer software under this License. 



9. MISCELLANEOUS. This License represents the complete 

agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision 

of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision 

shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it 

enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of 

the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within 

the Original Software (except to the extent applicable 

law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdictions
