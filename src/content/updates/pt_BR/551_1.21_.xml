Sun warrants to you that for a period of 90 days from the date of 
purchase, as evidenced by a copy of the receipt, the media on which 
Software is furnished (if any) will be free of defects in materials and 
workmanship under normal use. Except for the foregoing, Software is 
provided "AS IS". Your exclusive remedy and Sun's entire liability under 
this limited warranty will be at Sun's option to replace Software media 
or refund the fee paid for Software. Some states do not allow 
limitations on certain implied warranties, so the above may not apply to 
you. This limited warranty gives you specific legal rights. You may have 
others, which vary from state to state.

9.	Disclaimer of Warranty.

UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, 
REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF 
MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT 
ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO 
BE LEGALLY INVALID.

10. 	Limitation of Liability.

TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS 
LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR 
SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, 
HOWEVER CAUSED REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR 
RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN 
ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. In no event will Sun's 
liability to you, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or 
otherwise, exceed the amount paid by you for Software under this 
Agreement. The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated 
warranty fails of its essential purpose. Some states do not allow the 
exclusion of incidental or consequential damages, so some of the terms 
above may not be applicable to you.

11. 	Export Regulations.

All Software, documents, technical data, and any other materials 
delivered under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export control laws 
and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries. 
You agree to comply strictly with these laws and regulations and 
acknowledge that you have the responsibility to obtain any licenses to 
export, re-export, or import as may be required after delivery to you.

12. 	U.S. Government Restricted Rights.

If Software is being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S. Government or 
by a U.S. Government prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier), 
then the Government's rights in Software and accompanying documentation 
will be only as set forth in this Agreement; this is in accordance with 
48 CFR 227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense (DOD) 
acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD acquisitions).

13. 	Governing Law.

Any action related to this Agreement will be governed by California law 
and controlling U.S. federal law. No choice of law rules of any 
jurisdiction will apply.

14. 	Severability.

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be unenforceable, this 
Agreement will remain in effect with the provision omitted, unless 
omission would frustrate the intent of the parties, in which case this 
Agreement will immediately terminate.

15. 	Integration.

This Agreement, including any terms contained in your Entitlement, is 
the entire agreement between you and Sun relating to its subject matter. 
It supersedes all prior or contemporaneous oral or written 
communications, proposals, representations and warranties and prevails 
over any conflicting or additional terms of any quote, order, 
acknowledgment, or other communication between the parties relating to 
its subject matter during the term of this Agreement. No modification of 
this Agreement will be binding, unless in writing and signed by an 
authorized representative of each party.

                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
                       Version 2.1, February 1999
 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]
                            Preamble
  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.
  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.
  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.
  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.
  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.
  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.
  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.
  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.
  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.
  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.
  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.
  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.
  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.
  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.
  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.
                  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION
  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".
  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.
  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)
  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.
  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.
  
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.
  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.
  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.
    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.
    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.
    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.
    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)
These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.
Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.
In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.
  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.
  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.
  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.
  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.
  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.
  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.
  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.
  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.
  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)
  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.
  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.
  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:
    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)
    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.
    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.
    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.
    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.
  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.
  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.
  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:
    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.
    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.
  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.
  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.
  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.
  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.
If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.
It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.
This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.
  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.
  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.
Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.
  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.
                            NO WARRANTY
  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.
                     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS
           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries
  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).
  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.
    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>
    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.
    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Lesser General Public License for more details.
    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.
You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:
  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the

      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.
      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.
      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.
      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.
      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).
      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.
      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."
      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.
   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.
   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.
   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:
      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and
      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and
      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and
      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.
      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.
   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.
   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.
   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.
   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.
   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
		       Version 2.1, February 1999

 Copyright (C) 1991, 1999 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
     59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA
 Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
 of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.

[This is the first released version of the Lesser GPL.  It also counts
 as the successor of the GNU Library Public License, version 2, hence
 the version number 2.1.]

			    Preamble

  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your
freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public
Licenses are intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change
free software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.

  This license, the Lesser General Public License, applies to some
specially designated software packages--typically libraries--of the
Free Software Foundation and other authors who decide to use it.  You
can use it too, but we suggest you first think carefully about whether
this license or the ordinary General Public License is the better
strategy to use in any particular case, based on the explanations below.

  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom of use,
not price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that
you have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge
for this service if you wish); that you receive source code or can get
it if you want it; that you can change the software and use pieces of
it in new free programs; and that you are informed that you can do
these things.

  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid
distributors to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender these
rights.  These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for
you if you distribute copies of the library or if you modify it.

  For example, if you distribute copies of the library, whether gratis
or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that we gave
you.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source
code.  If you link other code with the library, you must provide
complete object files to the recipients, so that they can relink them
with the library after making changes to the library and recompiling
it.  And you must show them these terms so they know their rights.

  We protect your rights with a two-step method: (1) we copyright the
library, and (2) we offer you this license, which gives you legal
permission to copy, distribute and/or modify the library.

  To protect each distributor, we want to make it very clear that
there is no warranty for the free library.  Also, if the library is
modified by someone else and passed on, the recipients should know
that what they have is not the original version, so that the original
author's reputation will not be affected by problems that might be
introduced by others.

  Finally, software patents pose a constant threat to the existence of
any free program.  We wish to make sure that a company cannot
effectively restrict the users of a free program by obtaining a
restrictive license from a patent holder.  Therefore, we insist that
any patent license obtained for a version of the library must be
consistent with the full freedom of use specified in this license.

  Most GNU software, including some libraries, is covered by the
ordinary GNU General Public License.  This license, the GNU Lesser
General Public License, applies to certain designated libraries, and
is quite different from the ordinary General Public License.  We use
this license for certain libraries in order to permit linking those
libraries into non-free programs.

  When a program is linked with a library, whether statically or using
a shared library, the combination of the two is legally speaking a
combined work, a derivative of the original library.  The ordinary
General Public License therefore permits such linking only if the
entire combination fits its criteria of freedom.  The Lesser General
Public License permits more lax criteria for linking other code with
the library.

  We call this license the "Lesser" General Public License because it
does Less to protect the user's freedom than the ordinary General
Public License.  It also provides other free software developers Less
of an advantage over competing non-free programs.  These disadvantages
are the reason we use the ordinary General Public License for many
libraries.  However, the Lesser license provides advantages in certain
special circumstances.

  For example, on rare occasions, there may be a special need to
encourage the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes
a de-facto standard.  To achieve this, non-free programs must be
allowed to use the library.  A more frequent case is that a free
library does the same job as widely used non-free libraries.  In this
case, there is little to gain by limiting the free library to free
software only, so we use the Lesser General Public License.

  In other cases, permission to use a particular library in non-free
programs enables a greater number of people to use a large body of
free software.  For example, permission to use the GNU C Library in
non-free programs enables many more people to use the whole GNU
operating system, as well as its variant, the GNU/Linux operating
system.

  Although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is
linked with the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run
that program using a modified version of the Library.

  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and
modification follow.  Pay close attention to the difference between a
"work based on the library" and a "work that uses the library".  The
former contains code derived from the library, whereas the latter must
be combined with the library in order to run.

		  GNU LESSER GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE
   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

  0. This License Agreement applies to any software library or other
program which contains a notice placed by the copyright holder or
other authorized party saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this Lesser General Public License (also called "this License").
Each licensee is addressed as "you".

  A "library" means a collection of software functions and/or data
prepared so as to be conveniently linked with application programs
(which use some of those functions and data) to form executables.

  The "Library", below, refers to any such software library or work
which has been distributed under these terms.  A "work based on the
Library" means either the Library or any derivative work under
copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the Library or a
portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated
straightforwardly into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is
included without limitation in the term "modification".)

  "Source code" for a work means the preferred form of the work for
making modifications to it.  For a library, complete source code means
all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated
interface definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation
and installation of the library.

  Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not
covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of
running a program using the Library is not restricted, and output from
such a program is covered only if its contents constitute a work based
on the Library (independent of the use of the Library in a tool for
writing it).  Whether that is true depends on what the Library does
and what the program that uses the Library does.
  
  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Library's
complete source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that
you conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an
appropriate copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact
all the notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any
warranty; and distribute a copy of this License along with the
Library.

  You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy,
and you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a
fee.

  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion
of it, thus forming a work based on the Library, and copy and
distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1
above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:

    a) The modified work must itself be a software library.

    b) You must cause the files modified to carry prominent notices
    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    c) You must cause the whole of the work to be licensed at no
    charge to all third parties under the terms of this License.

    d) If a facility in the modified Library refers to a function or a
    table of data to be supplied by an application program that uses
    the facility, other than as an argument passed when the facility
    is invoked, then you must make a good faith effort to ensure that,
    in the event an application does not supply such function or
    table, the facility still operates, and performs whatever part of
    its purpose remains meaningful.

    (For example, a function in a library to compute square roots has
    a purpose that is entirely well-defined independent of the
    application.  Therefore, Subsection 2d requires that any
    application-supplied function or table used by this function must
    be optional: if the application does not supply it, the square
    root function must still compute square roots.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If
identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Library,
and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in
themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those
sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you
distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based
on the Library, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of
this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the
entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote
it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest
your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to
exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or
collective works based on the Library.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Library
with the Library (or with a work based on the Library) on a volume of
a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under
the scope of this License.

  3. You may opt to apply the terms of the ordinary GNU General Public
License instead of this License to a given copy of the Library.  To do
this, you must alter all the notices that refer to this License, so
that they refer to the ordinary GNU General Public License, version 2,
instead of to this License.  (If a newer version than version 2 of the
ordinary GNU General Public License has appeared, then you can specify
that version instead if you wish.)  Do not make any other change in
these notices.

  Once this change is made in a given copy, it is irreversible for
that copy, so the ordinary GNU General Public License applies to all
subsequent copies and derivative works made from that copy.

  This option is useful when you wish to copy part of the code of
the Library into a program that is not a library.

  4. You may copy and distribute the Library (or a portion or
derivative of it, under Section 2) in object code or executable form
under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you accompany
it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source code, which
must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a
medium customarily used for software interchange.

  If distribution of object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the
source code from the same place satisfies the requirement to
distribute the source code, even though third parties are not
compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

  5. A program that contains no derivative of any portion of the
Library, but is designed to work with the Library by being compiled or
linked with it, is called a "work that uses the Library".  Such a
work, in isolation, is not a derivative work of the Library, and
therefore falls outside the scope of this License.

  However, linking a "work that uses the Library" with the Library
creates an executable that is a derivative of the Library (because it
contains portions of the Library), rather than a "work that uses the
library".  The executable is therefore covered by this License.
Section 6 states terms for distribution of such executables.

  When a "work that uses the Library" uses material from a header file
that is part of the Library, the object code for the work may be a
derivative work of the Library even though the source code is not.
Whether this is true is especially significant if the work can be
linked without the Library, or if the work is itself a library.  The
threshold for this to be true is not precisely defined by law.

  If such an object file uses only numerical parameters, data
structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and small inline
functions (ten lines or less in length), then the use of the object
file is unrestricted, regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work.  (Executables containing this object code plus portions of the
Library will still fall under Section 6.)

  Otherwise, if the work is a derivative of the Library, you may
distribute the object code for the work under the terms of Section 6.
Any executables containing that work also fall under Section 6,
whether or not they are linked directly with the Library itself.

  6. As an exception to the Sections above, you may also combine or
link a "work that uses the Library" with the Library to produce a
work containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work
under terms of your choice, provided that the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use and reverse
engineering for debugging such modifications.

  You must give prominent notice with each copy of the work that the
Library is used in it and that the Library and its use are covered by
this License.  You must supply a copy of this License.  If the work
during execution displays copyright notices, you must include the
copyright notice for the Library among them, as well as a reference
directing the user to the copy of this License.  Also, you must do one
of these things:

    a) Accompany the work with the complete corresponding
    machine-readable source code for the Library including whatever
    changes were used in the work (which must be distributed under
    Sections 1 and 2 above); and, if the work is an executable linked
    with the Library, with the complete machine-readable "work that
    uses the Library", as object code and/or source code, so that the
    user can modify the Library and then relink to produce a modified
    executable containing the modified Library.  (It is understood
    that the user who changes the contents of definitions files in the
    Library will not necessarily be able to recompile the application
    to use the modified definitions.)

    b) Use a suitable shared library mechanism for linking with the
    Library.  A suitable mechanism is one that (1) uses at run time a
    copy of the library already present on the user's computer system,
    rather than copying library functions into the executable, and (2)
    will operate properly with a modified version of the library, if
    the user installs one, as long as the modified version is
    interface-compatible with the version that the work was made with.

    c) Accompany the work with a written offer, valid for at
    least three years, to give the same user the materials
    specified in Subsection 6a, above, for a charge no more
    than the cost of performing this distribution.

    d) If distribution of the work is made by offering access to copy
    from a designated place, offer equivalent access to copy the above
    specified materials from the same place.

    e) Verify that the user has already received a copy of these
    materials or that you have already sent this user a copy.

  For an executable, the required form of the "work that uses the
Library" must include any data and utility programs needed for
reproducing the executable from it.  However, as a special exception,
the materials to be distributed need not include anything that is
normally distributed (in either source or binary form) with the major
components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the operating system on
which the executable runs, unless that component itself accompanies
the executable.

  It may happen that this requirement contradicts the license
restrictions of other proprietary libraries that do not normally
accompany the operating system.  Such a contradiction means you cannot
use both them and the Library together in an executable that you
distribute.

  7. You may place library facilities that are a work based on the
Library side-by-side in a single library together with other library
facilities not covered by this License, and distribute such a combined
library, provided that the separate distribution of the work based on
the Library and of the other library facilities is otherwise
permitted, and provided that you do these two things:

    a) Accompany the combined library with a copy of the same work
    based on the Library, uncombined with any other library
    facilities.  This must be distributed under the terms of the
    Sections above.

    b) Give prominent notice with the combined library of the fact
    that part of it is a work based on the Library, and explaining
    where to find the accompanying uncombined form of the same work.

  8. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or distribute
the Library except as expressly provided under this License.  Any
attempt otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense, link with, or
distribute the Library is void, and will automatically terminate your
rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies,
or rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses
terminated so long as such parties remain in full compliance.

  9. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not
signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or
distribute the Library or its derivative works.  These actions are
prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by
modifying or distributing the Library (or any work based on the
Library), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and
all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Library or works based on it.

  10. Each time you redistribute the Library (or any work based on the
Library), the recipient automatically receives a license from the
original licensor to copy, distribute, link with or modify the Library
subject to these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further
restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the rights granted herein.
You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties with
this License.

  11. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),
conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot
distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you
may not distribute the Library at all.  For example, if a patent
license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Library by
all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then
the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Library.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply,
and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any
patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any
such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the
integrity of the free software distribution system which is
implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made
generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed
through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing
to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot
impose that choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to
be a consequence of the rest of this License.

  12. If the distribution and/or use of the Library is restricted in
certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the
original copyright holder who places the Library under this License may add
an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries,
so that distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus
excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if
written in the body of this License.

  13. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new
versions of the Lesser General Public License from time to time.
Such new versions will be similar in spirit to the present version,
but may differ in detail to address new problems or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Library
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and
"any later version", you have the option of following the terms and
conditions either of that version or of any later version published by
the Free Software Foundation.  If the Library does not specify a
license version number, you may choose any version ever published by
the Free Software Foundation.

  14. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Library into other free
programs whose distribution conditions are incompatible with these,
write to the author to ask for permission.  For software which is
copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation, write to the Free
Software Foundation; we sometimes make exceptions for this.  Our
decision will be guided by the two goals of preserving the free status
of all derivatives of our free software and of promoting the sharing
and reuse of software generally.

			    NO WARRANTY

  15. BECAUSE THE LIBRARY IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO
WARRANTY FOR THE LIBRARY, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.
EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR
OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE LIBRARY "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY
KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE
IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE
LIBRARY IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE LIBRARY PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME
THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

  16. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN
WRITING WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY
AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE LIBRARY AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU
FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR
CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE
LIBRARY (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA BEING
RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE LIBRARY TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER SOFTWARE), EVEN IF
SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGES.

		     END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

           How to Apply These Terms to Your New Libraries

  If you develop a new library, and you want it to be of the greatest
possible use to the public, we recommend making it free software that
everyone can redistribute and change.  You can do so by permitting
redistribution under these terms (or, alternatively, under the terms of the
ordinary General Public License).

  To apply these terms, attach the following notices to the library.  It is
safest to attach them to the start of each source file to most effectively
convey the exclusion of warranty; and each file should have at least the
"copyright" line and a pointer to where the full notice is found.

    <one line to give the library's name and a brief idea of what it does.>
    Copyright (C) <year>  <name of author>

    This library is free software; you can redistribute it and/or
    modify it under the terms of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License as published by the Free Software Foundation; either
    version 2.1 of the License, or (at your option) any later version.

    This library is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,
    but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of
    MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU
    Lesser General Public License for more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU Lesser General Public
    License along with this library; if not, write to the Free Software
    Foundation, Inc., 59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA  02111-1307  USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your
school, if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the library, if
necessary.  Here is a sample; alter the names:

  Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the
  library `Frob' (a library for tweaking knobs) written by James Random Hacker.

  <signature of Ty Coon>, 1 April 1990
  Ty Coon, President of Vice

That's all there is to it!

      "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
      other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common
      control with that entity. For the purposes of this definition,
      "control" means (i) the power, direct or indirect, to cause the
      direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

      "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
      exercising permissions granted by this License.

      "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
      including but not limited to software source code, documentation
      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
      and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical

      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent

      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,

      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

3.1 below and subject to third party intellectual property 
claims, each Contributor hereby grants You a world-wide, 
royalty-free, non-exclusive license: 

(a) under intellectual property rights (other than patent 
or trademark) Licensable by Contributor to use, reproduce, 
modify, display, perform, sublicense and distribute the 
Modifications created by such Contributor (or portions 
thereof), either on an unmodified basis, with other 
Modifications, as Covered Software and/or as part of a 
Larger Work; and 

(b) under Patent Claims infringed by the making, using, 
or selling of Modifications made by that Contributor either 
alone and/or in combination with its Contributor Version 
(or portions of such combination), to make, use, sell, 
offer for sale, have made, and/or otherwise dispose of: 
(1) Modifications made by that Contributor (or portions 
thereof); and 
(2) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor 
with its Contributor Version (or portions of such combination). 

(c) The licenses granted in Sections

or otherwise makes the Modifications available to a third party.

(d) Notwithstanding Section 

2.2(b) above, no patent license is granted: 
(1) for any code that Contributor has deleted from the Contributor Version; 
(2) for infringements caused by: 
(i) third party modifications of Contributor Version, or 
(ii) the combination of Modifications made by that Contributor with other 
software (except as part of the Contributor Version) or other devices; or 
(3) under Patent Claims infringed by Covered Software in the absence of 
Modifications made by that Contributor. 

3. Distribution Obligations. 

3.1. Availability of Source Code. Any Covered Software that You 
distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form must 
also be made available in Source Code form and that Source Code 
form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. 
You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the 
Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or 
otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any 
such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can 
obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a 
reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for 
software exchange. 

3.2. Modifications. The Modifications that You create or to 
which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License. 
You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your 
original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to 
grant the rights conveyed by this License. 

3.3. Required Notices. You must include a notice in each of 
Your Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of 
the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, 
patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, 
or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving 
attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer. 

3.4. Application of Additional Terms. You may not offer or 
impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form 
that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License 
or the recipients rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, 
and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or 
liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered 
Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, 
and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. 
You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, 
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You 
alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer 
and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial 
Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, 
indemnity or liability terms You offer.

3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute 
the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms 
of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, 
which may contain terms different from this License, provided 
that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and 
that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to 
limit or alter the recipients rights in the Source Code form 
from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute 
the Covered Software in Executable form under a different 
license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms 
which differ from this License are offered by You alone, 
not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby 
agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor 
for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such 
Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. 

3.6. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining 
Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms of 
this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. 
In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this 
License are fulfilled for the Covered Software. 

4. Versions of the License. 

4.1. New Versions. Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial 
license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions 
of this License from time to time. Each version will be given 
a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 

4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to 
modify this License. 

4.2. Effect of New Versions. You may always continue to use, 
distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available 
under the terms of the version of the License under which You 
originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial 
Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting 
it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any 
subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make 
the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of
 the License under which You originally received the Covered 
Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or 
otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms 
of any subsequent version of the License published by the 
license steward. 

4.3. Modified Versions. When You are an Initial Developer and 
You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, 
You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: 
(a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of 
the license steward (except to note that the license differs 
from this License); and 
(b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms 
which differ from this License. 

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER 
THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, 
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, 
WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, 
MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. 
THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED 
SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE 
IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER 
CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, 
REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES 
AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED 
SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 

6. TERMINATION. 

6.1. This License and the rights granted 
hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to 
comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach 
within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions 
which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the 
termination of this License shall survive. 

6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding 
declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer 
or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor 
against whom You assert such claim is referred to as 
Participant) alleging that the Participant Software 
(meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is 
a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant 
is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes 
any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or 
indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer 
(if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all 
Contributors under Sections 

2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice 
from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically 
at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if 
within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with 
respect to the Participant Software against such Participant 
either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with 
Participant. 

6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 

6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been 
validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder 
prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You 
by any distributor) shall survive termination. 

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND 
UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), 
CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, 
ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, 
OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY 
PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, 
DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, 
COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER 
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL 
HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY 
FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS 
NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH 
LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION 
OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO 
THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. The Covered Software is a 
commercial item, as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 
(Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer software 
(as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 252.227-7014(a)(1)) 
and commercial computer software documentation as such terms 
are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 
48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 
(June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered 
Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. 
Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any 
other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses 
Government rights in computer software under this License. 

9. MISCELLANEOUS. This License represents the complete 
agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision 
of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision 
shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it 
enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of 
the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within 
the Original Software (except to the extent applicable 
law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdictions 
conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this 
License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts 
located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice 
contained within the Original Software, with the losing 
party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, 
court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. 
The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts 
for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. 
Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a 
contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not 
apply to this License. You agree that You alone are 
responsible for compliance with the United States export 
administration regulations (and the export control laws 
and regulation of any other countries) when You use, 
distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. As between Initial Developer 
and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims 
and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its 
utilization of rights under this License and You agree to 
work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute 
such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein 
is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission 
of liability.

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the

          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed

      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

6.	Term and Termination. 

The license and service term are set forth in your Entitlement(s). Your rights under this Agreement will terminate immediately without notice from Sun if you materially breach it or take any action in derogation of Sun's and/or its licensors' rights to Software. Sun may terminate this Agreement should any Software become, or in Sun's reasonable opinion likely to become, the subject of a claim of intellectual property infringement or trade secret misappropriation. Upon termination, you will cease use of, and destroy, Software and confirm compliance in writing to Sun. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 9-15 will survive termination of the Agreement.

7.	Java Compatibility and Open Source.

Software may contain Java technology. You may not create additional classes to, or modifications of, the Java technology, except under compatibility requirements available under a separate agreement available at www.java.net.

Sun supports and benefits from the global community of open source developers, and thanks the community for its important contributions and open standards-based technology, which Sun has adopted into many of its products.

Please note that portions of Software may be provided with notices and open source licenses from such communities and third parties that govern the use of those portions, and any licenses granted hereunder do not alter any rights and obligations you may have under such open source licenses, however, the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provisions in this Agreement will apply to all Software in this distribution.

8. 	Limited Warranty. 

Sun warrants to you that for a period of 90 days from the date of purchase, as evidenced by a copy of the receipt, the media on which Software is furnished (if any) will be free of defects in materials and workmanship under normal use. Except for the foregoing, Software is provided "AS IS". Your exclusive remedy and Sun's entire liability under this limited warranty will be at Sun's option to replace Software media or refund the fee paid for Software. Some states do not allow limitations on certain implied warranties, so the above may not apply to you. This limited warranty gives you specific legal rights. You may have others, which vary from state to state.

9.	Disclaimer of Warranty. 

UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED, EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE LEGALLY INVALID. 

10. 	Limitation of Liability. 

TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE USE OF OR INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. In no event will Sun's liability to you, whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount paid by you for Software under this Agreement. The foregoing limitations will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its essential purpose. Some states do not allow the exclusion of incidental or consequential damages, so some of the terms above may not be applicable to you. 

11. 	Export Regulations. 

All Software, documents, technical data, and any other materials delivered under this Agreement are subject to U.S. export control laws and may be subject to export or import regulations in other countries. You agree to comply strictly with these laws and regulations and acknowledge that you have the responsibility to obtain any licenses to export, re-export, or import as may be required after delivery to you. 

12. 	U.S. Government Restricted Rights. 

If Software is being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S. Government or by a U.S. Government prime contractor or subcontractor (at any tier), then the Government's rights in Software and accompanying documentation will be only as set forth in this Agreement; this is in accordance with 48 CFR 227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for Department of Defense (DOD) acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212 (for non-DOD acquisitions). 

13. 	Governing Law. 

Any action related to this Agreement will be governed by California law and controlling U.S. federal law. No choice of law rules of any jurisdiction will apply. 

14. 	Severability.

declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer or a
Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor against whom
You assert such claim is referred to as Participant) alleging
that the Participant Software (meaning the Contributor Version
where the Participant is a Contributor or the Original Software
where the Participant is the Initial Developer) directly or
indirectly infringes any patent, then any and all rights granted
directly or indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial
Developer (if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and
all Contributors under Sections 2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License
shall, upon 60 days notice from Participant terminate

grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, limited annual license for  your 
internal use of the Software on computer systems owned or leased by you and on 
your premises.  The registration process for the Software is provided in the 
installation guide.  

2.2	License to Evaluate.  Except as licensed under the terms of your Proof 
of License, Sun grants you a non-exclusive, non-transferable, royalty-free and 
limited license to use Software internally for evaluation purposes only, for a 
period of ninety (90) days following delivery of the Software. No license is 
granted hereunder for any other purpose, including any commercial or production 
use of the Software.  In relation to Software licensed under this Section 2.2, 
Sun is under no obligation to provide you with support, updates, error 
corrections or any other service.   Sections 4.0, and 5.0 of the General 
Supplemental Terms will not apply to Software being licensed under this Section 
2.2. The Software may contain a timebomb mechanism. You agree to hold Sun 
harmless from any claims based on your use of Software for any purposes other 
than those of internal evaluation.

2.3	Paid-Up License Grant.  Subject to your Proof of License, if you have 
paid the Paid-Up License Fee for a version of a specific Sun product(s) 
contained in the Software, Sun grants you a license to that version of that Sun 
product in accordance with the terms of Section 1 and Section 6 of the Binary 
Code License Agreement, notwithstanding any other terms of this Agreement to the 
contrary.  Sections 2.1, 3,  5.1, and 5.2 of the General Supplemental Terms 
shall not apply to any Software licensed under this Section 2.3, and Section 4.0 
shall not apply if you obtain your Paid-Up License in accordance with Section 
2.3.1 (Conversion from Subscription to Paid-Up License) and 5.3.2 below 
(Conversion Paid-Up License Fee).  Software licensed under this Section 2.3 may 
not be deployed for Service Provider Use, unless expressly permitted in the 
Proof of License.

2.3.1.	Conversion from Subscription to Paid-Up License.  Subject to your 
payment of the fee to convert to a Paid-Up License in Section 5.3.2 of the 
General Supplemental Terms, if you have paid annual license fees for three (3) 
consecutive years under Sections 5.1 and 5.2 of the General Supplemental Terms, 
you may continue to use the Software as it was then-deployed during your 
subscription, so long as such deployment of the Software subscription was 
consistent with the terms of this Agreement at the time of conversion, and 
provided that any further Service Provider Use of the Software shall 
discontinue.  You will be required to provide requested information as to how 
the Software was deployed during your subscription to update your Proof of 
License to reflect your Paid-Up License.
2.4	Software Use Restrictions.  Subject to your Proof of License, you may 
use the Software for the sole purpose of designing, developing and testing your 
applets and applications ("Programs").  To the extent that you are designing, 
developing and testing Programs for a particular version of the Java platform, 
any executable output generated by a compiler that is contained in the Software 
must (a) only be compiled from source code that conforms to the corresponding 
version of the OEM Java Language Specification; (b) be in the class file format 
defined by the corresponding version of the OEM Java Virtual Machine 
Specification; and (c) execute properly on a reference runtime, as specified by 
Sun, associated with such version of the Java platform..

2.5	Server Feature License.  The Server  Platforms are provided to you only 
for use in conjunction with the Software for the sole purpose of designing, 
developing and testing of applications intended to run on the Server Platform. 
Server Platforms may not be deployed in a production environment (whether 
internally or externally accessible) or used for production purposes, including 
without limitation deploying the Server Platforms to run your business.  If you 
wish to deploy the Server Platforms in a production environment (whether 
internally or externally accessible) or use them for production purposes, 
including without limitation deploying the Server Platforms to run your business 
, you must purchase separate and appropriate licenses for the Server Platforms.  
You may use the Server Platforms for the the limited purpose of testing, 
staging, or quality assurance of your Programs for subsequent deployment in a 
production environment.   These terms will supersede any inconsistent or 
confliciting terms in the BCL or Supplemental Terms and  will supersede any 
inconsistent or confliciting licenses contained within the Server Platforms.

2.6	Server Platform Sample Applications.  Server Platforms may include 
sample applications (including without limitation the Logistics) that are 
provided solely for reference purposes pursuant to the terms of this Agreement.  
The sample applications may not be redistributed unless expressly provided for 
in this Agreement.

2.7	License to Distribute Redistributables. Subject to your Proof of License 
and the terms of this Agreement, Sun grants you a non-exclusive, 
non-transferable, limited license to reproduce and distribute in binary form, 
those files identified as redistributable in the documentation for the Software 
("Redistributables"), provided that: (i) you distribute the Redistributables and 
related proprietary notices complete and unmodified, and only bundled as part of 
your Programs, (ii) you do not distribute additional software intended to 
supersede any component(s) of the Redistributables (unless otherwise specified 
in the documentation), (iii) if you are distributing Java applets and 
applications for a particular version of the Java platform, any executable 
output generated by a compiler that is contained in the Software must (a) only 
be compiled from source code that conforms to the corresponding version of the 
OEM Java Language Specification; (b) be in the class file format defined by the 
corresponding version of the OEM Java Virtual Machine Specification; and (c) 
execute properly on a reference runtime, as specified by Sun, associated with 
such version of the Java platform, (iv) the Redistributables are licensed in a 
manner that protects Sun's interests at least as well as this Agreement, and (v) 
you will defend, indemnify and hold harmless Sun and its licensors from and 
against any damages, costs, liabilities, settlement amounts and/or expenses 
(including attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with any claim, lawsuit or 
action by any third party that arises from the use or distribution of all 
software contained in your distribution.

2.8	Additional Restrictions.  You agree that, (i) if your Proof of License 
restricts use of Software or Component Product(s) to a number of designated 
CPU's, users or entries (meaning a single instance of a distinguished name 
including attributes associated therewith), you will not deploy the Software on 
more than that number of designated CPUs, exceed that maximum number of users or 
exceed the specified number of entries respectively, (ii) you may copy and use 
(but not modify) the header files and class libraries solely to create and 
distribute programs to interface with Software's APIs and only as expressly 
provided in the Software's documentation, (iii) unless otherwise specified, if 
Component Products are delivered with embedded or bundled software that enables 
functionality of the Component Product, you may not use such software on a 
stand-alone basis or use any portion of such software to interoperate with any 
program(s) other than the Software, (iv) Software may contain source code that 
is provided solely for reference purposes pursuant to the terms of this 
Agreement, (v) some portions of Software are provided with notices and/or open 
source licenses from other parties which govern the use of those portions, (vi) 
you may not publish or provide the results of any benchmark or comparison tests 
run on Software to any third party without the prior written consent of Sun, 
(vii) use of encryption technology contained within the Software is subject to 
all applicable governmental regulations of the United States of America and the 
country where the Software is deployed, (viii) you may not assign or otherwise 
transfer, by operation of law or otherwise, any of your rights or obligations 
under this Agreement without Sun's prior written consent, (ix) you may not sell, 
rent, loan or otherwise encumber Software, and (x) for the avoidance of doubt, 
the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provisions in this 
Agreement shall apply to all Software in this distribution.

3.0  	TERM AND TERMINATION.  The term of this Agreement shall be for the one 
(1) year, and shall automatically renew for successive one (1) year terms unless 
either party provides written notice to the other of its intention not to renew 
at least ninety (90) days prior to the commencement of the next term.  You will 
remain obligated for all fees through the date of termination.  Either party may 
terminate this Agreement if the other party materially breaches this Agreement 
and fails to remedy that breach within thirty (30) days of receipt of written 
notice of material breach from the non-breaching party.  Sun may terminate this 
Agreement immediately if (i) you fail to pay an invoice when due, or (ii) any 
Software becomes, or in Sun's reasonable opinion is likely to become, the 
subject of a claim of infringement or misappropriation of any intellectual 
property right.  Upon termination, you will cease all use of the Software, 
delete all copies of all Software, and if requested by Sun, certify the 
destruction of all Software, and Sun shall not have any further obligations 
under this Agreement.

4.0  	SUBSCRIPTION SUPPORT.  Upon (a) payment of fees when due under Sections 
5.1 and 5.2 and subject to the registration requirement set forth in Section 2.1 
of these General Supplemental Terms, or (b) payment of fees when due under 
Section 5.3.1, you will be eligible to receive developer services in accordance 
with the respective program rules provided at 
http://www.sun.com/service/servicelist/, the terms of which are incorporated 
herein, which may include support, product updates, managed forums and 
specialized content.    All services offered may be subcontracted or assigned by 
Sun and are subject to Sun's then-current end of service life policies.   Such 
services must be received by you within the subscription year, and will expire 
at the end of that subscription year.

5.0  	FEES.

5.1  	First Year License Fee.  Upon commencement of this Agreement, a 
non-refundable, non-contingent base license fee for the first year of an amount 
equal to the Employee Base Count multiplied by the Employee Base License Fee 
shall be due prior to any obligations being incurred by Sun and prior to your 
exercise of any rights granted under Sections 2.1 and 4.0.

5.2  	Subsequent Annual License Fees.  Upon each anniversary of this 
Agreement, you will provide payment of an annual license fee of an amount equal 
to the Employee Base Count, as assessed on the anniversary date, multiplied by 
the then-current Employee Base License Fee.  Your Employee Base License Fee will 
not increase by more than an average of five percent (5%) compounded annually, 
as averaged over the product lifetime.

5.3  	Optional Paid-Up License Fee.  

5.3.1	Initial Paid-Up License Fees.  The Software or Component Product(s) may 
be licensed to you under the terms of this Agreement upon payment of Paid-Up 
License Fees in accordance with Sun's then-current standard published price 
lists available at that time for a paid-up license for the respective Sun 
product.  Developer services under Section 4.0 are included in the Paid-Up 
License Fee under this Section 5.3.1 for the first year.  Upon each anniversary 
of this Agreement, in order to continue receiving developer services, you must 
pay Sun a subsequent annual developer services fee in accordance with Sun's 
then-current standard published price lists available at that time.

5.3.2	Conversion Paid-Up License Fees.  If you have paid annual license fees 
for three (3) consecutive years under Sections 5.1 and 5.2 of these General 
Supplemental Terms, you may elect to pay Sun a Paid-Up License Fee equal to one 
point five times (1.5x) the then-current annual license fee for the Software.  
Payment of the Paid-Up License Fee under this Section 5.3.2 automatically 
converts the term of the Agreement to an unlimited time period solely for your 
then-currently deployed versions of the Software, subject to the Agreement 
termination provisions.

5.3.3	 Technical support services, maintenance services for upgrades and 
updates, professional services, architecture workshop services, training 
services, or installation services are not included in the Paid-Up License Fee 
under Section 5.3.2, and the delivery of any such services would be subject to 
Sun's then-current prices, terms and conditions.  

6.0 	REPORTING AND AUDIT. During the term of this Agreement and for five (5) 
years following termination of this Agreement, Sun shall have a right to audit 
your facilities and records from time to time in order to verify you compliance 
with the terms and conditions of this Agreement. Any such audit shall only take 
place during your normal business hours and upon no less than ten (10) days 
prior written notice from Sun.  Sun shall conduct no more than one such audit in 
any twelve-month period except for the express purpose of assuring compliance in 
such cases where non-compliance has been established in a prior audit. Sun will 
give written notice of any non-compliance, and if a payment deficiency exists, 
then you shall have fifteen (15) days from the date of such notice to make 
payment to Sun for any payment deficiency. The amount of the payment deficiency 
will be determined by multiplying the underreported number of Employees, as of 
the anniversary date of this Agreement, by the Employee Base License Fee.  If 
Sun determines that the underreported number of Employees exceeds five percent 
(5%) of the represented number of Employees, then in addition to the payment 
deficiency, Sun may recover from you the costs of the audit, and interest 
charges for the payment deficiency at the lesser of 1.5% per month or the 
highest rate allowable by law.

7.0  	JAVA TECHNOLOGY.  The following terms apply to Java technology 
components contained in the Software ("Java Technology").

7.1. 	Java Technology Restrictions.  You may not modify the Java Platform 
Interface ("JPI", identified as classes contained within the "java" package or 
any subpackages of the "java" package), by creating additional classes within 
the JPI or otherwise causing the addition to or modification of the classes in 
the JPI. In the event that you create an additional class and associated API(s) 
which (i) extends the functionality of the Java platform, and (ii) is exposed to 
third party software developers for the purpose of developing additional 
software which invokes such additional API, you must promptly broadly publish an 
accurate specification for such API for free use by all developers. You may not 
create, or authorize your licensees to create, additional classes, interfaces, 
or subpackages that are in any way identified as "java", "javax", "sun" or 
similar convention as specified by Sun in any naming convention designation.

7.2 	SOFTWARE UPDATES FROM SUN. You acknowledge that at your request or 
consent optional features of the Software may download, install, and execute 
applets, applications, software extensions, and updated versions of the Software 
from Sun ("Software Updates"), which may require you to accept updated terms and 
conditions for installation. If additional terms and conditions are not 
presented on installation, the Software Updates will be considered part of the 
Software and subject to the terms and conditions of the Agreement.
7.3 	SOFTWARE FROM SOURCES OTHER THAN SUN. You acknowledge that, by your use 
of optional features of the Software and/or by requesting services that require 
use of the optional features of the Software, the Software may automatically 
download, install, and execute software applications from sources other than Sun 
("Other Software"). Sun makes no representations of a relationship of any kind 
to licensors of Other Software. TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT 
WILL SUN OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR DATA, OR FOR 
SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED 
REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE USE OF 
OR INABILITY TO USE OTHER SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

8.0  	limitation of liability.  The following sentence shall replace the 
second sentence of Section 5 "Limitation of Liability" in the Binary Code 
License portion of this Agreement:  "In no event will Sun's liability to you, 
whether in contract, tort (including negligence), or otherwise, exceed the 
annual license fees last paid by you for the Software under this Agreement."

9.0 	Trademarks and Logos.  You acknowledge and agree as between you and Sun 
that Sun owns the SUN, SOLARIS, JAVA, SUN ONE, trademarks and related 
trademarks, service marks, logos, trade dress and other brand designations ("Sun 
Marks"), and you agree to comply with the Sun Trademark and Logo Usage 
Requirements currently located at http://www.sun.com/policies/trademarks. You 
agree not to: (a) challenge Sun's ownership or use of Sun Marks; (b) attempt to 
register any Sun Marks or any mark or logo substantially similar thereto; (c) 
remove, alter or add to any Sun Mark; (d) co-brand or co-logo your products with 
any Sun Marks; or (e) incorporate any Sun Marks into your trademarks, product 
names, service marks, company names, domain names or any other similar 
designations. Any use you make of the Sun Marks inures to Sun's benefit. 

10.0  	SERVICE PROVIDER USE.  You will defend and indemnify Sun and its 
licensors from and against any damages, costs, liabilities, settlement amounts 
and/or expenses (including attorneys' fees) incurred in connection with any 
claim, lawsuit or action by any third party that arises from your Service 
Provider Use of Software.

  <license name="LICENSE"><![CDATA[The GNU General Public License (GPL)

Version 2, June 1991

Copyright (C) 1989, 1991 Free Software Foundation, Inc.
59 Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA

Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies of this license
document, but changing it is not allowed.

Preamble

The licenses for most software are designed to take away your freedom to share
and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public License is intended to
guarantee your freedom to share and change free software--to make sure the
software is free for all its users.  This General Public License applies to
most of the Free Software Foundation's software and to any other program whose
authors commit to using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is
covered by the GNU Library General Public License instead.) You can apply it to
your programs, too.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  Our
General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you have the freedom to
distribute copies of free software (and charge for this service if you wish),
that you receive source code or can get it if you want it, that you can change
the software or use pieces of it in new free programs; and that you know you
can do these things.

To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid anyone to deny
you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.  These restrictions
translate to certain responsibilities for you if you distribute copies of the
software, or if you modify it.

For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether gratis or for
a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that you have.  You must
make sure that they, too, receive or can get the source code.  And you must
show them these terms so they know their rights.

We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and (2)
offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy, distribute
and/or modify the software.

Also, for each author's protection and ours, we want to make certain that
everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free software.  If the
software is modified by someone else and passed on, we want its recipients to
know that what they have is not the original, so that any problems introduced
by others will not reflect on the original authors' reputations.

Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software patents.  We
wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free program will
individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the program proprietary.
To prevent this, we have made it clear that any patent must be licensed for
everyone's free use or not licensed at all.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification
follow.

TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION

0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains a notice
placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed under the terms of
this General Public License.  The "Program", below, refers to any such program
or work, and a "work based on the Program" means either the Program or any
derivative work under copyright law: that is to say, a work containing the
Program or a portion of it, either verbatim or with modifications and/or
translated into another language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included
without limitation in the term "modification".) Each licensee is addressed as
"you".

Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not covered by
this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of running the Program is
not restricted, and the output from the Program is covered only if its contents
constitute a work based on the Program (independent of having been made by
running the Program).  Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.

1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program's source code as
you receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice and
disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the notices that refer to this License
and to the absence of any warranty; and give any other recipients of the
Program a copy of this License along with the Program.

You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and you may
at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.

2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion of it, thus
forming a work based on the Program, and copy and distribute such modifications
or work under the terms of Section 1 above, provided that you also meet all of
these conditions:

    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices stating
    that you changed the files and the date of any change.

    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in whole or
    in part contains or is derived from the Program or any part thereof, to be
    licensed as a whole at no charge to all third parties under the terms of
    this License.

    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively when run,
    you must cause it, when started running for such interactive use in the
    most ordinary way, to print or display an announcement including an
    appropriate copyright notice and a notice that there is no warranty (or
    else, saying that you provide a warranty) and that users may redistribute
    the program under these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy
    of this License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but does
    not normally print such an announcement, your work based on the Program is
    not required to print an announcement.)

These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If identifiable
sections of that work are not derived from the Program, and can be reasonably
considered independent and separate works in themselves, then this License, and
its terms, do not apply to those sections when you distribute them as separate
works.  But when you distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a
work based on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms
of this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the entire
whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.

Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest your
rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to exercise the
right to control the distribution of derivative or collective works based on
the Program.

In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program with the
Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of a storage or
distribution medium does not bring the other work under the scope of this
License.

3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it, under
Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of Sections 1 and
2 above provided that you also do one of the following:

    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable source
    code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above
    on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three years, to
    give any third party, for a charge no more than your cost of physically
    performing source distribution, a complete machine-readable copy of the
    corresponding source code, to be distributed under the terms of Sections 1
    and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,

    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer to
    distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is allowed only
    for noncommercial distribution and only if you received the program in
    object code or executable form with such an offer, in accord with
    Subsection b above.)

The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for making
modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source code means all
the source code for all modules it contains, plus any associated interface
definition files, plus the scripts used to control compilation and installation
of the executable.  However, as a special exception, the source code
distributed need not include anything that is normally distributed (in either
source or binary form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on)
of the operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component
itself accompanies the executable.

If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering access to copy
from a designated place, then offering equivalent access to copy the source
code from the same place counts as distribution of the source code, even though
third parties are not compelled to copy the source along with the object code.

4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program except as
expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt otherwise to copy, modify,
sublicense or distribute the Program is void, and will automatically terminate
your rights under this License.  However, parties who have received copies, or
rights, from you under this License will not have their licenses terminated so
long as such parties remain in full compliance.

5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not signed it.
However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or distribute the Program
or its derivative works.  These actions are prohibited by law if you do not
accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or distributing the Program (or
any work based on the Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to
do so, and all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying
the Program or works based on it.

6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the Program),
the recipient automatically receives a license from the original licensor to
copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to these terms and conditions.
You may not impose any further restrictions on the recipients' exercise of the
rights granted herein.  You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by
third parties to this License.

7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent
infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues), conditions
are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or otherwise) that
contradict the conditions of this License, they do not excuse you from the
conditions of this License.  If you cannot distribute so as to satisfy
simultaneously your obligations under this License and any other pertinent
obligations, then as a consequence you may not distribute the Program at all.
For example, if a patent license would not permit royalty-free redistribution
of the Program by all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through
you, then the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to
refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.

If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under any
particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to apply and
the section as a whole is intended to apply in other circumstances.

It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any patents or
other property right claims or to contest validity of any such claims; this
section has the sole purpose of protecting the integrity of the free software
distribution system, which is implemented by public license practices.  Many
people have made generous contributions to the wide range of software
distributed through that system in reliance on consistent application of that
system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing to
distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot impose that
choice.

This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to be a
consequence of the rest of this License.

8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in certain
countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the original
copyright holder who places the Program under this License may add an explicit
geographical distribution limitation excluding those countries, so that
distribution is permitted only in or among countries not thus excluded.  In
such case, this License incorporates the limitation as if written in the body
of this License.

9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of the
General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will be similar in
spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to address new problems
or concerns.

Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program
specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and "any later
version", you have the option of following the terms and conditions either of
that version or of any later version published by the Free Software Foundation.
If the Program does not specify a version number of this License, you may
choose any version ever published by the Free Software Foundation.

10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free programs
whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author to ask for
permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free Software Foundation,

NO WARRANTY

11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR
THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE
STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE
PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED,
INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND
FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND
PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE,
YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.

12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING WILL
ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR REDISTRIBUTE THE
PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE USE OR
INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF DATA OR DATA
BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A
FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER
OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.

END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

How to Apply These Terms to Your New Programs

If you develop a new program, and you want it to be of the greatest possible
use to the public, the best way to achieve this is to make it free software
which everyone can redistribute and change under these terms.

To do so, attach the following notices to the program.  It is safest to attach
them to the start of each source file to most effectively convey the exclusion
of warranty; and each file should have at least the "copyright" line and a
pointer to where the full notice is found.

    One line to give the program's name and a brief idea of what it does.

    Copyright (C) <year> <name of author>

    This program is free software; you can redistribute it and/or modify it
    under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by the Free
    Software Foundation; either version 2 of the License, or (at your option)
    any later version.

    This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful, but WITHOUT
    ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of MERCHANTABILITY or
    FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  See the GNU General Public License for
    more details.

    You should have received a copy of the GNU General Public License along
    with this program; if not, write to the Free Software Foundation, Inc., 59
    Temple Place, Suite 330, Boston, MA 02111-1307 USA

Also add information on how to contact you by electronic and paper mail.

If the program is interactive, make it output a short notice like this when it
starts in an interactive mode:

    Gnomovision version 69, Copyright (C) year name of author Gnomovision comes
    with ABSOLUTELY NO WARRANTY; for details type 'show w'.  This is free
    software, and you are welcome to redistribute it under certain conditions;
    type 'show c' for details.

The hypothetical commands 'show w' and 'show c' should show the appropriate
parts of the General Public License.  Of course, the commands you use may be
called something other than 'show w' and 'show c'; they could even be
mouse-clicks or menu items--whatever suits your program.

You should also get your employer (if you work as a programmer) or your school,
if any, to sign a "copyright disclaimer" for the program, if necessary.  Here
is a sample; alter the names:

    Yoyodyne, Inc., hereby disclaims all copyright interest in the program
    'Gnomovision' (which makes passes at compilers) written by James Hacker.

    signature of Ty Coon, 1 April 1989

    Ty Coon, President of Vice

This General Public License does not permit incorporating your program into
proprietary programs.  If your program is a subroutine library, you may
consider it more useful to permit linking proprietary applications with the
library.  If this is what you want to do, use the GNU Library General Public
License instead of this License.


"CLASSPATH" EXCEPTION TO THE GPL

Certain source files distributed by Sun Microsystems, Inc.  are subject to
the following clarification and special exception to the GPL, but only where
Sun has expressly included in the particular source file's header the words
"Sun designates this particular file as subject to the "Classpath" exception
as provided by Sun in the LICENSE file that accompanied this code."

    Linking this library statically or dynamically with other modules is making
    a combined work based on this library.  Thus, the terms and conditions of
    the GNU General Public License cover the whole combination.

    As a special exception, the copyright holders of this library give you
    permission to link this library with independent modules to produce an
    executable, regardless of the license terms of these independent modules,
    and to copy and distribute the resulting executable under terms of your
    choice, provided that you also meet, for each linked independent module,
    the terms and conditions of the license of that module.  An independent
    module is a module which is not derived from or based on this library.  If
    you modify this library, you may extend this exception to your version of
    the library, but you are not obligated to do so.  If you do not wish to do
    so, delete this exception statement from your version.

      source, and configuration files.

      "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
      transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
      and conversions to other media types.

      "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
      Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
      copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

      "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
      form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
      editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
      represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
      of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
      separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
      the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

      "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
      the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions
      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof, that is intentionally
      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work by the copyright owner
      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized to submit on behalf of
      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
      to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
      communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,

      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
      designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

      "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
      on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
      subsequently incorporated within the Work.

   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
      Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

   3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
      this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
      (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
      use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
      where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
      with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
      institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
      cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
      or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
      or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
      granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
      as of the date such litigation is filed.

   4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
      Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
      modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
      meet the following conditions:

      (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
          Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

      (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
          stating that You changed the files; and

      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
          that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
          attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
          excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
          the Derivative Works; and

      (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
          distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
          include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
          within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
          pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
          of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
          wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
          of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
          do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
          notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
          or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
          that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
          as modifying the License.

      You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
      may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
      for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
      for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
      reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
      the conditions stated in this License.

   5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
      any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
      by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
      this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
      Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
      the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

   6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
      names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
      except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
      origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

   7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
      agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
      Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
      implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
      risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

   8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
      whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
      unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
      negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
      liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
      incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
      result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
      Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
      has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

   9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
      the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
      and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
      or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
      License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
      defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
      incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
      of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS

Modifications made by that Contributor. 

3. Distribution Obligations. 

3.1. Availability of Source Code. Any Covered Software that You 
distribute or otherwise make available in Executable form must 
also be made available in Source Code form and that Source Code 
form must be distributed only under the terms of this License. 
You must include a copy of this License with every copy of the 
Source Code form of the Covered Software You distribute or 
otherwise make available. You must inform recipients of any 
such Covered Software in Executable form as to how they can 
obtain such Covered Software in Source Code form in a 
reasonable manner on or through a medium customarily used for 
software exchange. 

3.2. Modifications. The Modifications that You create or to 
which You contribute are governed by the terms of this License. 
You represent that You believe Your Modifications are Your 
original creation(s) and/or You have sufficient rights to 
grant the rights conveyed by this License. 

3.3. Required Notices. You must include a notice in each of 
Your Modifications that identifies You as the Contributor of 
the Modification. You may not remove or alter any copyright, 
patent or trademark notices contained within the Covered Software, 
or any notices of licensing or any descriptive text giving 
attribution to any Contributor or the Initial Developer. 

3.4. Application of Additional Terms. You may not offer or 
impose any terms on any Covered Software in Source Code form 
that alters or restricts the applicable version of this License 
or the recipients rights hereunder. You may choose to offer, 
and to charge a fee for, warranty, support, indemnity or 
liability obligations to one or more recipients of Covered 
Software. However, you may do so only on Your own behalf, 
and not on behalf of the Initial Developer or any Contributor. 
You must make it absolutely clear that any such warranty, 
support, indemnity or liability obligation is offered by You 
alone, and You hereby agree to indemnify the Initial Developer 
and every Contributor for any liability incurred by the Initial 
Developer or such Contributor as a result of warranty, support, 
indemnity or liability terms You offer.

3.5. Distribution of Executable Versions. You may distribute 
the Executable form of the Covered Software under the terms 
of this License or under the terms of a license of Your choice, 
which may contain terms different from this License, provided 
that You are in compliance with the terms of this License and 
that the license for the Executable form does not attempt to 
limit or alter the recipients rights in the Source Code form 
from the rights set forth in this License. If You distribute 
the Covered Software in Executable form under a different 
license, You must make it absolutely clear that any terms 
which differ from this License are offered by You alone, 
not by the Initial Developer or Contributor. You hereby 
agree to indemnify the Initial Developer and every Contributor 
for any liability incurred by the Initial Developer or such 
Contributor as a result of any such terms You offer. 

3.6. Larger Works. You may create a Larger Work by combining 
Covered Software with other code not governed by the terms of 
this License and distribute the Larger Work as a single product. 
In such a case, You must make sure the requirements of this 
License are fulfilled for the Covered Software. 

4. Versions of the License. 

4.1. New Versions. Sun Microsystems, Inc. is the initial 
license steward and may publish revised and/or new versions 
of this License from time to time. Each version will be given 
a distinguishing version number. Except as provided in Section 

4.3, no one other than the license steward has the right to 
modify this License. 

4.2. Effect of New Versions. You may always continue to use, 
distribute or otherwise make the Covered Software available 
under the terms of the version of the License under which You 
originally received the Covered Software. If the Initial 
Developer includes a notice in the Original Software prohibiting 
it from being distributed or otherwise made available under any 
subsequent version of the License, You must distribute and make 
the Covered Software available under the terms of the version of
 the License under which You originally received the Covered 
Software. Otherwise, You may also choose to use, distribute or 
otherwise make the Covered Software available under the terms 
of any subsequent version of the License published by the 
license steward. 

4.3. Modified Versions. When You are an Initial Developer and 
You want to create a new license for Your Original Software, 
You may create and use a modified version of this License if You: 
(a) rename the license and remove any references to the name of 
the license steward (except to note that the license differs 
from this License); and 
(b) otherwise make it clear that the license contains terms 
which differ from this License. 

5. DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY. COVERED SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED UNDER 
THIS LICENSE ON AN AS IS BASIS, WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, 
EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, 
WARRANTIES THAT THE COVERED SOFTWARE IS FREE OF DEFECTS, 
MERCHANTABLE, FIT FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGING. 
THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE COVERED 
SOFTWARE IS WITH YOU. SHOULD ANY COVERED SOFTWARE PROVE DEFECTIVE 
IN ANY RESPECT, YOU (NOT THE INITIAL DEVELOPER OR ANY OTHER 
CONTRIBUTOR) ASSUME THE COST OF ANY NECESSARY SERVICING, 
REPAIR OR CORRECTION. THIS DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY CONSTITUTES 
AN ESSENTIAL PART OF THIS LICENSE. NO USE OF ANY COVERED 
SOFTWARE IS AUTHORIZED HEREUNDER EXCEPT UNDER THIS DISCLAIMER. 

6. TERMINATION. 

6.1. This License and the rights granted 
hereunder will terminate automatically if You fail to 
comply with terms herein and fail to cure such breach 
within 30 days of becoming aware of the breach. Provisions 
which, by their nature, must remain in effect beyond the 
termination of this License shall survive. 

6.2. If You assert a patent infringement claim (excluding 
declaratory judgment actions) against Initial Developer 
or a Contributor (the Initial Developer or Contributor 
against whom You assert such claim is referred to as 
Participant) alleging that the Participant Software 
(meaning the Contributor Version where the Participant is 
a Contributor or the Original Software where the Participant 
is the Initial Developer) directly or indirectly infringes 
any patent, then any and all rights granted directly or 
indirectly to You by such Participant, the Initial Developer 
(if the Initial Developer is not the Participant) and all 
Contributors under Sections 

2.1 and/or 2.2 of this License shall, upon 60 days notice 
from Participant terminate prospectively and automatically 
at the expiration of such 60 day notice period, unless if 
within such 60 day period You withdraw Your claim with 
respect to the Participant Software against such Participant 
either unilaterally or pursuant to a written agreement with 
Participant. 

6.3. In the event of termination under Sections 

6.1 or 6.2 above, all end user licenses that have been 
validly granted by You or any distributor hereunder 
prior to termination (excluding licenses granted to You 
by any distributor) shall survive termination. 

7. LIMITATION OF LIABILITY. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES AND 
UNDER NO LEGAL THEORY, WHETHER TORT (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), 
CONTRACT, OR OTHERWISE, SHALL YOU, THE INITIAL DEVELOPER, 
ANY OTHER CONTRIBUTOR, OR ANY DISTRIBUTOR OF COVERED SOFTWARE, 
OR ANY SUPPLIER OF ANY OF SUCH PARTIES, BE LIABLE TO ANY 
PERSON FOR ANY INDIRECT, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL, OR CONSEQUENTIAL 
DAMAGES OF ANY CHARACTER INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, 
DAMAGES FOR LOST PROFITS, LOSS OF GOODWILL, WORK STOPPAGE, 
COMPUTER FAILURE OR MALFUNCTION, OR ANY AND ALL OTHER 
COMMERCIAL DAMAGES OR LOSSES, EVEN IF SUCH PARTY SHALL 
HAVE BEEN INFORMED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. 
THIS LIMITATION OF LIABILITY SHALL NOT APPLY TO LIABILITY 
FOR DEATH OR PERSONAL INJURY RESULTING FROM SUCH PARTYS 
NEGLIGENCE TO THE EXTENT APPLICABLE LAW PROHIBITS SUCH 
LIMITATION. SOME JURISDICTIONS DO NOT ALLOW THE EXCLUSION 
OR LIMITATION OF INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES, SO 
THIS EXCLUSION AND LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU. 

8. U.S. GOVERNMENT END USERS. The Covered Software is a 
commercial item, as that term is defined in 48 C.F.R. 2.101 
(Oct. 1995), consisting of commercial computer software 
(as that term is defined at 48 C.F.R. 252.227-7014(a)(1)) 
and commercial computer software documentation as such terms 
are used in 48 C.F.R. 12.212 (Sept. 1995). Consistent with 
48 C.F.R. 12.212 and 48 C.F.R. 227.7202-1 through 227.7202-4 
(June 1995), all U.S. Government End Users acquire Covered 
Software with only those rights set forth herein. This U.S. 
Government Rights clause is in lieu of, and supersedes, any 
other FAR, DFAR, or other clause or provision that addresses 
Government rights in computer software under this License. 

9. MISCELLANEOUS. This License represents the complete 
agreement concerning subject matter hereof. If any provision 
of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision 
shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it 
enforceable. This License shall be governed by the law of 
the jurisdiction specified in a notice contained within 
the Original Software (except to the extent applicable 
law, if any, provides otherwise), excluding such jurisdictions 
conflict-of-law provisions. Any litigation relating to this 
License shall be subject to the jurisdiction of the courts 
located in the jurisdiction and venue specified in a notice 
contained within the Original Software, with the losing 
party responsible for costs, including, without limitation, 
court costs and reasonable attorneys fees and expenses. 
The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts 
for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. 
Any law or regulation which provides that the language of a 
contract shall be construed against the drafter shall not 
apply to this License. You agree that You alone are 
responsible for compliance with the United States export 
administration regulations (and the export control laws 
and regulation of any other countries) when You use, 
distribute or otherwise make available any Covered Software.

10. RESPONSIBILITY FOR CLAIMS. As between Initial Developer 
and the Contributors, each party is responsible for claims 
and damages arising, directly or indirectly, out of its 
utilization of rights under this License and You agree to 
work with Initial Developer and Contributors to distribute 
such responsibility on an equitable basis. Nothing herein 
is intended or shall be deemed to constitute any admission 
of liability.

Software may contain Java technology. You may not create
additional classes to, or modifications of, the Java
technology, except under compatibility requirements
available under a separate agreement available
at www.java.net.

Sun supports and benefits from the global community of open
source developers, and thanks the community for its
important contributions and open standards-based technology,
which Sun has adopted into many of its products.

Please note that portions of Software may be provided with
notices and open source licenses from such communities and
third parties that govern the use of those portions, and any
licenses granted hereunder do not alter any rights and
obligations you may have under such open source licenses,
however, the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of
liability provisions in this Agreement will apply to all
Software in this distribution.

7. Term and Termination. 

The license and service term are set forth in your
Entitlement(s). Your rights under this Agreement will
terminate immediately without notice from Sun if you
materially breach it or take any action in derogation of
Sun's and/or its licensors' rights to Software. Sun may
terminate this Agreement should any Software become, or in
Sun's reasonable opinion likely to become, the subject of a
claim of intellectual property infringement or trade secret
misappropriation. Upon termination, you will cease use of,
and destroy, Software and confirm compliance in writing to
Sun. Sections 1, 5, 6, 7, and 9-15 will survive termination
of the Agreement.

8. Limited Warranty. 

Sun warrants to you that for a period of 90 days from the
date of purchase, as evidenced by a copy of the receipt,
the media on which Software is furnished (if any) will be
free of defects in materials and workmanship under normal
use. Except for the foregoing, Software is provided "AS IS".
Your exclusive remedy and Sun's entire liability under this
limited warranty will be at Sun's option to replace Software
media or refund the fee paid for Software. Some states do
not allow limitations on certain implied warranties, so the
above may not apply to you. This limited warranty gives you
specific legal rights. You may have others, which vary from
state to state.

9. Disclaimer of Warranty. 

UNLESS SPECIFIED IN THIS AGREEMENT, ALL EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
CONDITIONS, REPRESENTATIONS AND WARRANTIES, INCLUDING ANY
IMPLIED WARRANTY OF MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
PARTICULAR PURPOSE OR NON-INFRINGEMENT ARE DISCLAIMED,
EXCEPT TO THE EXTENT THAT THESE DISCLAIMERS ARE HELD TO BE
LEGALLY INVALID. 

10. Limitation of Liability. 

TO THE EXTENT NOT PROHIBITED BY LAW, IN NO EVENT WILL SUN
OR ITS LICENSORS BE LIABLE FOR ANY LOST REVENUE, PROFIT OR
DATA, OR FOR SPECIAL, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, INCIDENTAL
OR PUNITIVE DAMAGES, HOWEVER CAUSED REGARDLESS OF THE THEORY
OF LIABILITY, ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE USE OF OR
INABILITY TO USE SOFTWARE, EVEN IF SUN HAS BEEN ADVISED OF
THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES. In no event will Sun's
liability to you, whether in contract, tort (including
negligence), or otherwise, exceed the amount paid by you for
Software under this Agreement. The foregoing limitations
will apply even if the above stated warranty fails of its
essential purpose. Some states do not allow the exclusion of
incidental or consequential damages, so some of the terms
above may not be applicable to you. 

11. Export Regulations. 

All Software, documents, technical data, and any other
materials delivered under this Agreement are subject to U.S.
export control laws and may be subject to export or import
regulations in other countries. You agree to comply strictly
with these laws and regulations and acknowledge that you
have the responsibility to obtain any licenses to export,
re-export, or import as may be required after delivery to
you. 

12. U.S. Government Restricted Rights. 

If Software is being acquired by or on behalf of the U.S.
Government or by a U.S. Government prime contractor or
subcontractor (at any tier), then the Government's rights
in Software and accompanying documentation will be only as
set forth in this Agreement; this is in accordance with
48 CFR 227.7201 through 227.7202-4 (for Department of
Defense (DOD) acquisitions) and with 48 CFR 2.101 and 12.212
(for non-DOD acquisitions). 

13. Governing Law. 

Any action related to this Agreement will be governed by
California law and controlling U.S. federal law. No choice
of law rules of any jurisdiction will apply. 

14. Severability. 

If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
unenforceable, this Agreement will remain in effect with the
provision omitted, unless omission would frustrate the
intent of the parties, in which case this Agreement will
immediately terminate.

15. Integration. 

This Agreement, including any terms contained in your
Entitlement, is the entire agreement between you and Sun
relating to its subject matter. It supersedes all prior or
contemporaneous oral or written communications, proposals,
representations and warranties and prevails over any
conflicting or additional terms of any quote, order,
acknowledgment, or other communication between the parties
relating to its subject matter during the term of this
Agreement. No modification of this Agreement will be
binding, unless in writing and signed by an authorized
representative of each party.
