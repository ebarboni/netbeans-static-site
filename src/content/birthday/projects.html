<br>
Over the years, the NetBeans project has worked in tandem with other
open source projects and communities. Learn about some of these
partnerships and the benefits of our collaboration to
developers looking to take their projects to the next level.<br>

      <p><strong></strong>GlassFish is Sun's open sourced application
server. Its current version, GlassFish v3, has been rewritten so that
it is modular, lightweight, and extensible. It is built atop OSGi and
supports Java EE 6. Not only Java web applications can be deployed to
it: Ruby and Groovy are supported too. NetBeans IDE supports GlassFish.
When you create a new Java web application, you can specify that you
want it to be deployed to GlassFish. You can also view the applications
that are deployed to GlassFish and undeploy them from within the IDE.</p>

      <p><strong></strong>The MySQL database has become the world's
most popular open source database because of its consistent fast
performance, high reliability and ease of use. It is used on every
continent by individual web developers as well as many of the world's
largest and fastest-growing organizations to save time and money
powering their high-volume web sites, business-critical systems and
packaged software. NetBeans IDE simplifies the creation of applications
that connect to MySQL databases and enables you to create, view, and
change MySQL databases from within the IDE.<br>

      <p><strong></strong>OpenSolaris is an operating system (OS), an
open source project licensed under CDDL, and a community. OpenSolaris
is free and well-suited for desktops, laptops, servers, and data
centers. OpenSolaris has special features that distinguish it from
other operating systems. For example, it includes DTrace, a utility
that lets users and administrators examine the internals of the
operating system and dynamically modify its kernel. Supporting this
feature, NetBeans IDE provides a graphical user interface on top of
DTrace so that NetBeans users on OpenSolaris can easily visualize
DTrace output.<br>

      <p><strong></strong>Sun Microsystems established the OpenJDK
Community for the ongoing development of Sun's open-source
implementation of Java SE. The OpenJDK Community is where developers
gather to collaborate on the open-source JDK code base and related
projects. The OpenJDK 6 and 7 Projects in which the open-source code
base lives are part of this community. Through the OpenJDK Projects,
developers can directly influence the future of the JDK implementation,
participate with their peers in an open community and help take Java
technology where it hasn't been before. The OpenJDK is made available
as NetBeans projects. Once you have downloaded them, you can simply
open them in the IDE and work with them as you would with any other
project.</p>
