<h1>NetBeans Community Acceptance Testing Program 6.5 (NetCAT)</h1>

<p>The NetBeans Community Acceptance Testing program (NetCAT) is a testing initiative that typically starts with a Beta release and lasts until the first Release Candidate build. This takes 3 months on average. The basic idea is that a group of 60 volunteers from NetBeans community is using daily development builds and share their findings with NetBeans developers throughout the stabilization phase until predefined Quality Criteria are met. 
</p>
<p>This timely evaluation and testing of new features on real projects with real data has significant impact on overall stability of the final product. It's actually a win-win solution because NetBeans developers get to know about serious defects early enough to fix them and end users get matured IDE. Since its inception in 2004 NetCAT has gained a lot of recognition and became very popular and respected project among both NetBeans Engineering and NetBeans Community.
